<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-most-websites-don-t-convert-here-are-5-ai-fixes">Most Websites Don’t Convert. Here Are 5 AI Fixes.</h2>



<p>A good website is not everything—98% of the visitors will exit without looking for anything else. And it’s not in the traffic—most websites are built without lead capture, qualification, and conversion in mind. AI builds on top of that, answering questions while visitors browse or shop, guiding the most likely to convert, personalizing their content and core interactions.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><em>By analyzing visitor behavior, ranking potential customers based on brand engagement, and identifying those likely to convert, AI can transform your website into a lead-generation powerhouse. But it needs page views, time on page and engagement signals, to know who the buyers are.</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-ai-helps-you-stop-guessing-find-the-right-leads">1. <strong>AI Helps You Stop Guessing:</strong> Find the Right Leads</h2>



<p><strong>The Problem</strong> – In most companies, the biggest time wasters account for 50% or more of your overall sales time, wasted trying to reach out to unqualified leads. Instead of helping you close deals, AI delivers insights to ensure that your team doesn’t chase the wrong prospects.</p>



<p><strong>How AI explains</strong> — AI studies visitor patterns, assigns scores based on conversion probability, and showcases the best of the best. It assesses page visits, time spent, and engagement signals to determine who’s ready to buy.</p>



<p><strong>Case in Point: Carson Group’s AI-Lead Scoring<br></strong>One company that was spending way too much time pursuing unqualified leads was Carson Group, an investment advisory firm. They used an AI-powered lead scoring system that analyzed Salesforce data to determine with high accuracy which leads would convert. This would eventually lead their advisors to have only prospects with great value, resulting in better customer acquisition and thus improving their sales process efficiency by multiple folds.<br><em>Source: </em><a href="https://provectus.com/case-studies/ml-lead-scoring-investment-advisory-firm/"><em>Provectus Case Study</em></a></p>



<p><strong>How it matters:</strong> You can filter out cold leads with AI, allowing your entire team to focus their efforts on customers that actually have the potential to close deals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-ai-personalized-content-treat-every-visitor-as-unique">2. <strong>AI-Personalized Content:</strong> Treat Every Visitor as Unique</h2>



<p><strong>The Problem</strong> – The majority of websites serve identical material to all site visitors, resulting in low engagement and increased bounce rate.</p>



<p><strong>AI Solution</strong> – It modifies content, CTAs, and special offers dynamically, depending on the action of the visitors. It can identify if a visitor is a new customer, a returning customer, or a BUYER-ready prospect and provide a customized experience.</p>



<p><strong>Example in the Wild: The AI-Generated Content of the ‘Thinking Traveller’</strong><strong><br></strong>They took advantage of web optimization solutions supported by AI that adjusted content in real-time based on the habits and preferences of users visiting the respective site. It also allowed them to experiment with individual pieces of content to see which messaging worked best. Once personalized content was injected, online booking inquiries increased by 33%, testifying that if you care to engage your readers/audiences, personalized content is the way to go.<br><em>Source:</em><a href="https://www.bloomreach.com/en/blog/ai-personalization-5-examples-business-challenges"><em> </em><em>Bloomreach Blog</em></a></p>



<p><strong>AI Ensures: </strong>Every visitor gets tailored content using AI, improving engagement and conversions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-never-lose-a-lead-again-ai-follows-up-for-you">3. <strong>Never Lose a Lead Again:</strong> AI Follows Up For You</h2>



<p><strong>The Problem</strong> – “So, I thought to delve deeper and see what else I was missing; I needed the right approach to comprehend these leads”</p>



<p><strong>How AI Solves It </strong>— AI automatically sends personalized emails, chat messages, or reminders based on how a visitor interacts with your website. Conversely, if a potential lead browses your website but doesn’t convert, AI ensures you follow up in time, so you don’t miss out on the opportunity.</p>



<p><strong>Case Study: Use AI to Better Follow Up Before Your Competitors Do at Yum Brands</strong><strong><br></strong>Yum Brands—the parent company of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and KFC—sought to increase customer engagement and reduce churn. They used new AI-enabled marketing automation systems to customize follow-up emails according to customers’ interests and previous purchases. This enabled them to provide highly relevant promotions, resulting in higher purchases and lower customer churn.<br><em>Source:</em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/taco-bell-and-kfcs-owner-says-ai-driven-marketing-is-boosting-purchases-ab3a5f36"> <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a></p>



<p><strong>Summary</strong> &#8211; AI nurtures leads so they don’t slip through the cracks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-get-to-the-bottom-of-why-visitors-are-bouncing-ai-analytics-reveal-what-s-not-working">4. <strong>Get To The Bottom Of Why Visitors Are Bouncing:</strong> AI Analytics Reveal What’s Not Working</h2>



<p><strong>The Problem</strong> &#8211; The basic analytics that most people are seeing at the moment just tell you how many visitors have left and never give you a reason why.<br><strong>How AI Fixes It</strong> &#8211; AI-centric analytics focus on visitor engagement, foretell stages of leaving, and give recommendations above and beyond standard reports.</p>



<p><strong>Example: AI-Generated Heatmaps for Webpage Optimization</strong><br>AI-Based Heatmaps are used to optimize web pages. For example, Every.org, a nonprofit fundraising platform, saw that users who started to make a donation were abandoning the process. AI-generated heatmaps showed that users were rage-clicking the donation button because the bandwidth was frozen on the payment form. They simplified multi-step payment—and once they did—Every.org noticed a 29.5% increase in successful donations.<br><em>Source:</em><a href="https://www.impressiondigital.com/blog/heat-maps/"><em> Impression Digital</em></a></p>



<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Using AI shows you what’s working and what’s not so that you can enhance and optimize using data.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-ai-and-conversions-smarter-ctas-seamless-forms">5. <strong>AI and Conversions:</strong> Smarter CTAs, Seamless Forms</h2>



<p><strong>Static Challenge</strong> – Static CTAs and run-of-the-mill forms don’t engage visitors at the key decision-making moments.</p>



<p><strong>AI Solution</strong> – AI-driven CTAs and forms reshape on-the-go as per user behavior. It can:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Modify Call To Action copy, position, or colour based on engagement severity</li>



<li>The tip: lessen friction and pre-fill the sections</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Findings: Adjusting CTA based on data through AI <br></strong>A marketing agency realized that they had good website traffic, but their conversion rate was low. Leveraging dynamic AI-driven CTA optimization, which changed placement, text, and even CTA colour according to well-worn visitor behaviour. Through machine learning, AI discovered that some users clicked on those buttons that appeared higher on the page, whereas some others responded better to CTAs that appeared after a scroll delay. CTA clicks increased by 30% after implementing adjustments driven by AI — adaptive lead capture at its best. <em>Source:</em><a href="https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/landing-page-cta-placement/"><em> Unbounce</em></a></p>



<p><strong>Core takeaway:</strong> AI is streamlining lead capture to make it much easier and frictionless for visitors to convert.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-maximize-conversions-minimize-effort-ai-is-the-key">Maximize Conversions, Minimize Effort: AI is the Key</h2>



<p>AI works better than old-school approaches for engaging, qualifying, and converting leads. By leveraging AI-powered lead scoring, hyper-personalization, automated follow-ups, website analytics, and smart CTAs, businesses can generate more leads without extra traffic.</p>

<p>One of the things we focus on as an <a href="/">website design agency</a> is staying sharp on what makes a website feel modern, creative and engaging. Over the past few years we’ve worked on a mix of projects using different design techniques and animation styles to help our clients stand out.</p>



<p>Here are eight of our favourite examples in no particular order</p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-soapbox">1. Soapbox</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/soapbox.mp4"></video></figure>



<p></p>



<p>We built the Soapbox site in 2024. They’ve completely rethought how people experience music using 3D holograms to bring legendary artists to life.</p>



<p>We created a scroll-triggered effect using Three.js that mimics stepping into a VR headset. It starts with a 3D model of a headpiece then moves into a full-screen video that shows off the platform before pulling you back out.</p>



<p>It does a great job of showing what Soapbox is all about. WebGL Three.js fixed scrolling and clever spacing all work together to create a properly immersive effect.</p>



<p>Props to Patrick and Tyler for making this one happen</p>



<p>Check it out here: https://www.soapbox.us/ </p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-recharge">2. Recharge </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/recharge-effect.mp4"></video></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Recharge is a global brand offering prepaid gift cards. We worked with them in 2024 to give their site a proper overhaul.</p>



<p>The main effect is a scrolling animation that takes you through the different types of cards they offer. We also built a 3D slider where users can explore different Recharge products and partner sites.</p>



<p>It uses a mix of a Three.js canvas for the floating bits and GSAP animations for the rest. Simple idea but well executed.</p>



<p>Big shout to the dev team and the client for being great to work with</p>



<p>Check it out: https://company.recharge.com/ </p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-gorilla-science">3. Gorilla Science</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gorilla.mp4"></video></figure>



<p></p>



<p>We built this one last year. Gorilla Science creates science content with a twist. There’s nothing too complex in terms of tech no 3D no fancy frameworks but it’s a great example of how to use animation and interaction to bring a site to life.</p>



<p>It’s all about the details here. Micro-interactions page transitions and subtle movement give it loads of personality.</p>



<p>Nice work from Peter and Tyler on this</p>



<p>Check it out: <a href="https://watchgorillascience.com/">https://watchgorillascience.com/</a></p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-nato-innovation-fund">4. Nato Innovation Fund </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nif.mp4"></video></figure>



<p></p>



<p>This was a long-running project across 2023 and 2024. The fund backs new tech that supports defence and security and they wanted a site that felt modern open and forward-looking.</p>



<p>We extended their brand visuals with custom icons and illustrations and added clean layouts and scroll-based animation to make it feel more dynamic without overdoing it.</p>



<p>Really nice to be involved with this one. Great team to work with</p>



<p>Check it out: https://www.nif.fund/</p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-landways">5. Landways</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/landways.mp4"></video></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Landways design and install digital infrastructure for stadiums and large venues. We built their new site to reflect that same level of innovation.</p>



<p>There’s no heavy tech here. Just smart use of animation hover states and scroll effects to give the site energy without affecting performance.</p>



<p>Clean modern and sharp. Exactly what it needed to be</p>



<p>Check it out: https://landways.com/</p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-fairvue">6. Fairvue</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fairvue.mp4"></video></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Fairvue Partners work in a sector that can feel a bit dry so this one was about showing that even serious businesses can have a fresh and engaging website.</p>



<p>The design is clean the animations are subtle and we used fixed-position scrolling to add some depth. No need for flashy effects just solid design and development doing their job</p>



<p>Check it out: <a href="https://www.fairvuepartners.com/">https://www.fairvuepartners.com/</a></p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-sitespan">7. SiTESPAN</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sitespan.mp4"></video></figure>



<p></p>



<p>This site is a good example of how we’re bringing more 3D work into our projects. It uses a WebGL background with light scroll-based movement to add a sense of depth.</p>



<p>It’s the kind of thing that makes a site feel different. You can tell when something has been properly designed and built and when it hasn’t. That’s what we’re focusing on here and pushing further in future builds like Modern</p>



<p>Check it out: https://sitespanllc.com/ </p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-altnets">8. Altnets</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/altnets.mp4"></video></figure>



<p></p>



<p>We’ve just launched the new Altnets site. It’s clean modern and has the right amount of motion and interactivity to keep things interesting.</p>



<p>No need for heavy libraries here. Just good design and lightweight code working together to make something that feels polished and professional</p>



<p>Check it out: https://www.altnets.co.SA/ </p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>



<p>Interactivity and animation are key to making a website feel engaging. They don’t just look good they help keep people on the page and make your brand more memorable.</p>



<p>And it doesn’t always mean big frameworks or complicated tech. A well-built site with the right design choices can go a long way.</p>



<p>These are just a few of the projects we’ve worked on recently. If you’re looking for a site that stands out and gets noticed <a href="/contact-us/">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>If you have worked on a design project, you likely understand how frustrating endless revisions can be. If feedback loops are not managed well, they can drain creativity and slow projects down; furthermore, they often cause frustration to both the designer and the client🤯.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Controlling feedback revisions is essential to allow projects to proceed smoothly and efficiently. This helpful process can be used to prevent getting hopelessly stuck and making changes indefinitely. At our <a href="/">web design agency</a>, it&#8217;s something we actively prioritise from the start of every project.</p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-root-causes-of-feedback-loops"><strong>The Root Causes of Feedback Loops</strong></h2>



<p>Nobody likes to get bad feedback, it sucks! However, that’s not the leading cause of endless revisions, it’s the vague, impractical feedback which is troublesome. Constructive feedback is always appreciated, it promotes collaboration with the clients, getting a strong outcome for everyone involved😇. The type of ‘bad’ feedback we are discussing in this article can look a lot like the following examples:</p>



<p><strong>Lengthy emails:</strong></p>



<p>A long email which rambles on will never be resolved quickly, and it becomes very easy to miss specific points, which leads to feedback going back and forth on repeat.</p>



<p><strong>Too many cooks:</strong></p>



<p>When there are too many decision-makers involved in one project, feedback tends to become conflicting and very confusing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Undetailed comments:</strong></p>



<p>Subjective feedback such as <em>&#8220;Make it pop&#8221;</em>, <em>“Change this”</em> or <em>&#8220;It’s not quite there&#8221;</em> can lack actionable direction, making it difficult for designers to implement meaningful changes.</p>



<p>Without structured revision rounds, feedback can become a never-ending process, with new suggestions emerging continuously.</p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-setting-clear-guidelines"><strong>Setting Clear Guidelines</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s discuss how we can establish clear boundaries early to prevent endless rounds of amends.</p>



<p>Firstly, setting clear deadlines for feedback submissions ensures that your project stays on schedule and keeps it progressing in the right direction. Secondly, we need to make the client aware of the approval hierarchy. This means that only one person will be the voice for communicating feedback between revision stages, keeping the feedback process clear and concise. Finally, we need to be breaking feedback up into a process like ACAF.</p>



<p>So what does ACAF mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>A</strong>sk &#8211; <strong>C</strong>ategorise &#8211; <strong>A</strong>ct &#8211; <strong>F</strong>ollow up</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="533" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Fewer-Revisions-Faster-Approvals-How-to-Manage-the-Web-Design-Feedback-Loop-2-1024x533.webp" alt="Fewer Revisions, Faster Approvals - How to Manage the Web Design Feedback Loop" class="wp-image-9933" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Fewer-Revisions-Faster-Approvals-How-to-Manage-the-Web-Design-Feedback-Loop-2-1024x533.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Fewer-Revisions-Faster-Approvals-How-to-Manage-the-Web-Design-Feedback-Loop-2-300x156.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Fewer-Revisions-Faster-Approvals-How-to-Manage-the-Web-Design-Feedback-Loop-2-768x400.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Fewer-Revisions-Faster-Approvals-How-to-Manage-the-Web-Design-Feedback-Loop-2-1536x800.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Fewer-Revisions-Faster-Approvals-How-to-Manage-the-Web-Design-Feedback-Loop-2-576x300.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Fewer-Revisions-Faster-Approvals-How-to-Manage-the-Web-Design-Feedback-Loop-2-1366x711.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Fewer-Revisions-Faster-Approvals-How-to-Manage-the-Web-Design-Feedback-Loop-2.webp 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>ACAF is a simple 4-step process to ensure we&#8217;re not just collecting feedback but using it to make meaningful improvements. It works by gathering, filtering and actioning customer feedback, ultimately closing the loop and keeping customers happy. Let’s break it down.</p>



<p><strong>Ask:</strong><strong> This is where we ask clients for feedback on a design. </strong><strong><br></strong><em>As we do all our design in Figma, we find it easiest to utilise the comment tool, so clients can leave direct feedback on the section of the design they are referring to.</em></p>



<p><strong>Categorise:</strong><strong> The feedback will then be split into categories. </strong><strong><br></strong><em>This helps us prioritise what needs attention urgently, what is an actionable fix, and what needs more clarification from the client.</em></p>



<p><strong>Act:</strong> <strong>Take action based on the feedback. </strong><strong><br></strong><em>This is where we will implement design changes, and refine any problem points.</em></p>



<p><strong>Follow-up:</strong> <strong>Close the loop by responding to customers.</strong></p>



<p>By following this process, you’re not just collecting feedback for fun, you’re actually doing something with it. Clients appreciate that, and when they see real changes, they’re far less likely to hit you with the dreaded <em>“Per my last email…” </em>👀.</p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-does-good-feedback-look-like"><strong>So What Does Good Feedback Look Like?</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve addressed some of the common root causes for getting stuck in a feedback loop due to unclear comments, but what does useful feedback look like?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Useful feedback is:</p>



<p><strong>Specific</strong><br><em>Addressing an issue clearly, leaves everyone on the same page.</em></p>



<p><strong>Visual</strong><br><em>Utilising tools like Figma, means we know exactly where the issue appears and what needs amending.</em></p>



<p><strong>Actionable</strong><br><em>Leaving realistic feedback in terms of budget and timescales.</em></p>



<p>Let’s take a look at some frequent feedback points and how they can be rephrased to help not only the designers but also to move the project forward.</p>



<p>I’m sure at least once, we’ve all been guilty of using unclear phrases like <em>“it needs more wow factor</em>” or <em>“can you make it more modern” 🤦</em> &#8211; instead, we need to think about what we are trying to communicate. What does “modern” mean to the client, do they want a minimalistic approach, or do they want to see a layout with more whitespace?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alternatively, the feedback could sound more like this <em>“Compared to our competitors, the design felt a little dated. Can we try a rounded font with a more contemporary colour scheme to brighten it up?” </em>Instantly, we have some actionable points of feedback to work on that will end up with fewer rounds of revisions and less back and forth with the client.✨</p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-take-control-of-the-feedback-loop"><strong>Take Control of The Feedback Loop</strong></h2>



<p>Endless rounds of revisions don’t just prolong projects, they frustrate everybody involved. By making sure you have clear guidelines in place using a tested process like ACAF, and making feedback visual (by incorporating tools like Figma Comments) you can put a stop to the dreaded ongoing feedback loop 🤩.</p>



<p>Imagine this… designs are approved on time, no endless email chains and everyone involved is happy. You’re thinking that’s crazy, right? It’s totally possible, next time you start a project, put this strategy in place and see how much smoother and shorter your feedback loops become.</p>

<p>AI is everywhere these days. It’s picking the songs in your Spotify playlist, suggesting what to watch next on Netflix, and even helping you write emails. But one area where AI is making a huge impact without a lot of people realising it &#8211; is in development.&nbsp; Especially in Web development where it&#8217;s assistance is helping to not only improve and speed-up the creation of the code behind the site, but to improve the users engagement and the tools that help monitor users interactions and the performance of a website.</p>



<p>Not long ago, launching a site meant days of manual coding and endless design tweaks. Now, AI is stepping in to take the heavy lifting off the developer’s plate – making websites more personalised, better performing, and far more efficient to build.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for a <a href="/">web design agency</a> that’s embracing this new era of AI-powered development, that’s what we do.</p>



<p>So, what does that actually mean? Let’s break it down.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-is-taking-over-the-tedious-tasks">AI is Taking Over the Tedious Tasks</h2>



<p>Building a website from scratch used to be a pain. Writing lines and lines of code, debugging, testing &#8211; over and over again. But now, AI is making that process far easier (and faster).&nbsp; Tools such as Github Copilot or Tabnine handle the time consuming and repetitive tasks in creating a website to allow developers more time to complete complex tasks and handle the aspects which AI hasn&#8217;t mastered yet.&nbsp; The tools don&#8217;t stop at just doing the repetitive tasks, they suggest code as you type, catch errors before they become a problem, and help you follow best practices, all of which saves a huge amount of time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="602" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/github-copilot-example-1024x602.avif" alt="" class="wp-image-8320" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/github-copilot-example-1024x602.avif 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/github-copilot-example-300x176.avif 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/github-copilot-example-768x451.avif 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/github-copilot-example-1536x902.avif 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/github-copilot-example-2048x1203.avif 2048w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/github-copilot-example-576x338.avif 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/github-copilot-example-1366x803.avif 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/github-copilot-example-1600x940.avif 1600w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/github-copilot-example-1920x1128.avif 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Tools like Github Copilot can handle repetitive and time consuming tasks and can ever write code for you.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-websites-are-getting-smarter-and-more-enjoyable-to-use">Websites Are Getting Smarter (and More Enjoyable to Use)</h2>



<p>A great website isn’t just about how it looks &#8211; it’s about how it feels to use. AI is making websites more personal, more interactive, and just&#8230; better.</p>



<p>Chatbots that don’t sound like robots – You know those little chat windows that pop up when you visit a site? AI-powered chatbots (like ChatGPT and Dialogflow) are getting really good at having actual conversations with visitors, answering questions, and even helping with customer support &#8211; without making people wait on hold.</p>



<p>Tools such as Zipy use AI to monitor and analyse user sessions helping to identify and capture errors and bugs in real time as users are interacting with the site and feeding back to developers with summarised and detailed notes along with recordings of the sessions.&nbsp; Helping developers to spot and fix bugs quickly and efficiently.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="551" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/chatgpt-conversion-example-1024x551.avif" alt="" class="wp-image-8321" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/chatgpt-conversion-example-1024x551.avif 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/chatgpt-conversion-example-300x162.avif 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/chatgpt-conversion-example-768x414.avif 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/chatgpt-conversion-example-1536x827.avif 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/chatgpt-conversion-example-2048x1103.avif 2048w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/chatgpt-conversion-example-576x310.avif 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/chatgpt-conversion-example-1366x736.avif 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/chatgpt-conversion-example-1600x862.avif 1600w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/chatgpt-conversion-example-1920x1034.avif 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Chatbots like ChatGPT have become so good at conversation that you can forget you&#8217;re talking to an AI.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-seo-is-also-getting-an-upgrade">SEO is also getting an Upgrade</h2>



<p>If you want people to find your website, you need <a href="/seo-digital-marketing-services/">good SEO</a>. But keeping up with Google’s algorithm changes can be like trying to hit a moving target.&nbsp; That’s where AI-powered SEO tools like Clearscope and SurferSEO come in. They analyse what’s ranking on Google right now and give you real-time recommendations on keywords, structure, and readability.&nbsp; They also help with the behind the scenes setup with generating meta tags automatically, just like with writing code it&#8217;s streamlining and doing the heavy lifting when it comes to the repetitive tasks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-creating-that-unique-image-or-video-is-now-possible-with-ai">Creating that unique Image or Video is now possible with AI</h2>



<p>Have you thought of a video for your hero that would sell your business best or the perfect image that represents your article but you don&#8217;t have the ability to create or capture it?&nbsp; AI has now become powerful and intelligent enough to be able to create a video or image with just a couple of words.&nbsp; DALLE·3 and Adobe Firefly can now create images that look just like a photographer had taken them and with Sora you can create videos that would take months to create normally. However, you have to be careful, as it can be <a href="/design/spotting-ai-content-how-to-avoid-being-fooled-online/">easy to spot an AI image</a>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="512" height="512" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ai-development-cloud.avif" alt="" class="wp-image-8295" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ai-development-cloud.avif 512w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ai-development-cloud-300x300.avif 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ai-development-cloud-150x150.avif 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ai-development-cloud-24x24.avif 24w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ai-development-cloud-48x48.avif 48w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ai-development-cloud-96x96.avif 96w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em> We used DALLE·3 to create this image.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-s-next">So… What’s Next?</h2>



<p>AI in web development is still evolving, but here’s where we’re headed next:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>AI-generated code</strong> – Developers will rely even more on AI to write and refine code, making the process faster and smoother.</li>



<li><strong>Voice search optimisation</strong> – More people are using voice assistants, so websites will need to be built with voice search in mind.</li>



<li><strong>AI-powered design</strong> – Expect smarter design suggestions, adaptive layouts, and even AI-generated animations.</li>



<li><strong>Predictive analytics</strong> – AI will help businesses understand what users want before they even realise it themselves.</li>



<li><strong>More accessible websites</strong> – AI will improve accessibility with real-time translations, voice navigation, and automatic captions.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>



<p>AI isn’t here to replace web developers &#8211; it’s here to make their jobs easier. From writing code and optimising SEO to making websites more interactive, AI is transforming web development in all the right ways.</p>



<p>AI-powered web development isn’t the future. It’s happening right now. And honestly? It’s pretty exciting.</p>

<p>Remember way back in the day in the history of <a href="/website-design/">website design</a>, when websites had buttons that you had to click and it was totally up to the designer what they said and how easy they were to spot?! Crazy, right?</p>



<p>How on earth were they expected to know what we were looking for, when they didn’t even know who we were, or why we were on their website?</p>



<p>Fortunately, it’s 2025 and we’ve come a long way from those archaic practices. The Web has evolved into a global, intelligent network of resources &#8211; we simply ask it what we need and it delivers us personalised results, guaranteed to be useful. AI has transformed how we interact online &#8211; the traditional website experience is very much dead.</p>



<p>However… We didn&#8217;t arrive at this point by accident. Plenty of traditional techniques have contributed to the way in which the web has evolved over the last 25 years, from minor features to major considerations that have been used to enhance the way we experience content.</p>



<p>Let’s have a look back at some of those techniques that were used to make websites <em>Self-Aware</em> &#8211; often missed by legacy website designers, but <em>always</em> appreciated by website visitors. You’ll hopefully have seen some of these in the wild!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay loop muted src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/xtz-darkmode-example.mp4" playsinline></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The XTZ.news site is a great example of how a website can seamlessly switch from light to dark mode.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dark-mode">Dark Mode</h2>



<p>We all know about Dark Mode, right? It’s that handy setting on our devices that stops you burning your eyes out when the outside world is… well, dark. Nowadays, with most of our web interactions being conversational, this goes unnoticed &#8211; but back in 2025 it was kind of a big deal.</p>



<p>You may remember a few websites having the ability to toggle between Light &amp; Dark versions, but did you consider that they could do this automatically for you?</p>



<p>Most of the coding languages we used to create websites offered a way to get both the time of day, as well as the visitors’ device settings.</p>



<p>It would be fairly straightforward for developers to not only create a Dark Mode for their site, but to have it switch depending on these factors without having to press a toggle.</p>



<p>This way, the website would automatically adapt itself &#8211; no more blinding people browsing in the dark with a bright white website, or having to compromise on design trying to design something that would appeal to both modes.</p>



<p>Illuminating! (or not, as the case may be…)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cookies">Cookies</h2>



<p>If you were visiting websites in 2025, you’ll know all about Cookies. Well &#8211; maybe not all about them, but at least that they existed &#8211; thanks to the never-ending slew of popups that you were presented with upon opening almost any site.</p>



<p>Alongside the sneaky things like data collection &amp; tracking, developers could also use Cookies to improve your experience of their websites. A couple of ways they could have done this might have included:</p>



<p><strong>Filter History</strong></p>



<p>Let’s say you had a shop, or some other sort of archive on your site. A visitor might only be looking for a particular thing, so they use your filters to narrow down their search. They find what they’re looking for and plan to come back later to review it. Great!</p>



<p>But… they come back later, and have to filter all over again. They are sad! Developers could use Cookies here to prevent this frustration. We wouldn’t want to just preload their search for them, as they might<em> not</em> want that &#8211; but an option as simple as &#8211;</p>



<p><em>‘Use my previous search’</em></p>



<p>&#8211; would help them get instantly back to their results. They are happy!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="539" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/amazon-contentsuggestions-example-1024x539-1.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8923" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/amazon-contentsuggestions-example-1024x539-1.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/amazon-contentsuggestions-example-1024x539-1-300x158.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/amazon-contentsuggestions-example-1024x539-1-768x404.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/06/amazon-contentsuggestions-example-1024x539-1-576x303.webp 576w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Amazon is an industry leader when it comes to seamless content suggestions. Notice above how I searched for garden tools; not only did it remember my searches but it also suggested garden essentials on a tile on the homepage as well.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Content Suggestions</strong></p>



<p>This one worked particularly well on sites offering different types of end goal &#8211; ie. Services, Products or just Articles. Maybe visitors found a post through a Google search, and as the website manager you wanted them to continue to explore. How would you know what they were interested in?</p>



<p>You may have heard of tools such as Clarity, used for capturing data from users visiting a web page. Though you may not have considered that this could also be done in real-time! Here’s a potential example:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You’re a pet store selling pets online. Your blog post covers the keeping of various kinds of pets, with paragraphs covering Small Mammals, Reptiles, Birds &amp; Fish.</li>



<li>You also sell Small Mammals, Reptiles, Birds &amp; Fish through categorised sections of your site.</li>



<li>Using IntersectionObserver technology, you could determine which sections of your post the visitor lingered on the longest &#8211; and tailor your suggested content accordingly. They skimmed the article but spent 10 minutes reading about fish? Show them more fish!</li>



<li>This data could be stored in Cookies, so it would constantly be kept up to date with what the visitor was interested in, and the suggested content updated in real-time.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-localisation">Localisation</h2>



<p>Localisation was really important on traditional websites where the content needed to be unique to visitors in different locations. This would generally be for a couple of reasons:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Language (they needed to be able to read the site!)</li>



<li>Physical Addresses (they might want directions, or a branch of the company nearest to them)</li>
</ul>



<p>Both of these could be automated to improve the UX of the website:</p>



<p><strong>Language</strong></p>



<p>To optimise websites for different languages, the content could be translated using either human translation (slow &amp; expensive, but most accurate) or AI translation (quick &amp; cheap, but sometimes made mistakes).</p>



<p>We could store these translations in the site, and use the visitor’s IP address to determine which country they were visiting from, and show the language that matched &#8211; while also providing a switch to allow them to change it if they wanted. Simple!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay loop muted src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/studyinn-languageexample.mp4" playsinline></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On <em><a href="/portfolio/study-inn/">Study Inn</a></em>, with click of a button all the content on the site changes from English, to Chinese or Hindi.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Physical Location</strong></p>



<p>In addition to just your country, we could also perform more accurate Geolocation. If you ever approved the browser popup ‘This site wants to know your location’ &#8211; congratulations, you’ve been geolocated!</p>



<p>Sites featuring Google Maps to show a location, or with a range of branches around the country, could use this to personalise your experience.</p>



<p>Instead of a regular map, it could show directions from your actual address.</p>



<p>Branches could automatically be sorted by nearest to you, making finding the right one much more convenient.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-speed-optimisation">Speed Optimisation</h2>



<p><strong>Preloading</strong></p>



<p>You may, or may not have heard of DNS Prefetching / Preloading. This was a technique where we instructed the user&#8217;s browser to load resources from somewhere before the page actually needed them &#8211; things like font files and external CSS were often ‘prefetched’. Did you know, though, that we could also fetch entire pages?</p>



<p>Using intelligent javascript, we could detect when someone’s mouse lingered on a button on the page &#8211; and then immediately preload that page’s content &#8211; <em>before</em> they actually opened the link.</p>



<p>This would result in that page loading much faster in their browser when they did decide to click on it &#8211; saving loading times and the potential for a lost lead.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay loop muted src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/soapbox-speedexample.mp4" playsinline></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The <em>Soapbox website has an entry button for this reason. It is pre-loading the content before you fully enter the site.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Performance Tests</strong></p>



<p>Another way that our websites could think for themselves is by using performance tests to analyse the capabilities of the visitor’s device, before serving them material appropriate to their power. Not everyone in 2025 possessed the newest, fanciest, ultra-beefy phones or computers &#8211; plenty of people (most, actually) were still working with limited hardware. We had the technology to display incredible 3D scenes, but what would be the point if it crippled users&#8217; devices?</p>



<p>Using relatively lightweight performance tests was a great way to determine whether their browser was up to the task &#8211; and if it wasn’t, web pages could be reduced to a version that still hit the mark visually, but was much less intensive to load. They could also determine other things such as media format support &amp;&nbsp; support for modern CSS such as scroll behaviour, to load resources appropriately.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-physical-sensors">Physical Sensors</h2>



<p>Did you know that many fingerprint sensors built into mobile phones in 2025 also doubled as heartbeat monitors?</p>



<p>I recently came across a calming/meditation app that used this feature to progressively enhance its UX &#8211; while going through the steps in the app, the user could measure their heartbeat and try to lower it through the calming sequences offered &#8211; and different sequences would be offered depending on your starting rate.</p>



<p>This is a great example of how physical attributes of a device could be used to improve the self-aware capabilities of a website or app.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-summary">In Summary…</h2>



<p>Plenty of our standard practices used by our Web Intelligence in 2050 have roots in some of the features mentioned above, alongside other advanced techniques used by designers &amp; developers to nail down the UX of their sites and make them as self-aware as possible, to tailor experiences to the users themselves.</p>



<p>Next time you’re building or commissioning something on the web, think about how it could be intelligently optimised in this way &#8211; your users will love you for it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world changed, including the business world and how we adjusted to a life lockdown. Suddenly, everyone had a favorite video platform—Google Meet, Teams, or Zoom—and “You&#8217;re on mute” became the most repeated phrase of the year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three years after the pandemic officially ended, are we now returning to the &#8220;old normal&#8221;? Are our clients looking for more meaningful relationships that include face-to-face meetings? Let’s explore how business meetings have evolved and what that means for client relationships today.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1536" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/back-to-work.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8945" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/back-to-work.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/back-to-work-300x200.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/back-to-work-1024x683.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/back-to-work-768x512.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/back-to-work-576x384.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/back-to-work-1366x911.webp 1366w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-boardroom-to-zoom-and-its-impact-on-our-relationships">Boardroom to Zoom &#8211; and its impact on our relationships</h3>



<p>During the pandemic businesses were forced to evolve rapidly into a new virtual world. We were no longer allowed to meet face to face to discuss projects, have a catch up or pitch our services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I always felt there was something a little cold about virtual meetings. While you could break the ice with a flickering camera, disconnected headphones, or the classic muted microphone, it never quite matched the energy of being in the same room.</p>



<p>However the convenience of the virtual meeting made a huge impact. The ability to go from one or two meetings a day to four or five was a major increase in productivity. More importantly, it opened doors to clients across the world, making it easier to form relationships without geographic limitations.</p>



<p>A major shift for our team—and many others in the web design and digital space—was the opportunity to build strong connections with international clients. We’ve had the privilege of working with businesses across the USA, South Africa, and Australia, relationships that may not have happened without this global shift.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shifting-back-to-face-to-face-engagement">Shifting back to face-to-face engagement</h3>



<p>But now that the pandemic is behind us, are we going back to the old ways? Over the past year, we’ve noticed a real shift—our clients are keen to meet face-to-face again. Whether it’s just catching up with a long term client face to face to discuss new projects or existing ones or in person sales pitches, we have definitely noticed an increase in requests to meet face to face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a team we are more than happy to be stepping out of the virtual world to meet our clients. So, we’re back on the road, jumping in the car or catching the train to see them. It’s a breath of fresh air being able to step away from the screen and have real, in-person conversations brings a new energy to our work. It allows us to connect, discuss ideas more freely, and collaborate in ways that just aren’t the same over a video call.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/back-to-work2.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8926" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/back-to-work2.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/back-to-work2-300x300.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/back-to-work2-150x150.webp 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/back-to-work2-768x768.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/back-to-work2-576x576.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/back-to-work2-24x24.webp 24w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/back-to-work2-48x48.webp 48w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/back-to-work2-96x96.webp 96w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-are-face-to-face-meetings-making-a-comeback">Why are face-to-face meetings making a comeback?</h3>



<p>Is it just digital fatigue, or is there something more bringing people back to in-person meetings? Many professionals have realised that virtual interactions often lack the engagement needed to build strong, long-term business relationships.</p>



<p>Face-to-face meetings develop trust and rapport in a way that emails and video calls cannot. Harvard Business Review carried out <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/a-face-to-face-request-is-34-times-more-successful-than-an-email">research </a>into email vs face to face requests and the studies showed that face to face communication is <strong>34 times</strong> more successful than over email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="/website-design/">web design</a> and development market is highly competitive and competition is fierce, businesses that are investing in personal connections are standing out. When you sit down with a client, you can read their expressions, feel the energy of the conversation, you can also have spontaneous conversations that actually end up sparking new ideas that might not happen on a call. Meeting in person isn’t just about talking, it&#8217;s about connecting. In a creative industry, working side by side like this isn’t just nice to have, it’s the best way to collaborate.</p>



<p>Additionally, decision-making processes can often be expedited in face-to-face settings. Many companies are also finding that clients are more receptive and engaged when discussions happen in person rather than through a screen.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-future-of-business-relationships">The future of business relationships</h3>



<p>From working through to Covid to the last few years since, I think this is beginning to come clear. Although technology has evolved and it makes it easier to connect, it can’t replace real human interaction. That’s why I believe in-person meetings are making a comeback—because people value genuine, face-to-face interaction.</p>



<p>Companies that are recognising this shift and making the effort to meet in person when it matters will be able to build stronger, more lasting relationships. After all, business isn’t just about emails and video calls—it’s about people. As we get back to meeting in boardrooms, cafés, and conference halls, it’s clear—nothing beats being in the same room. Talking, listening, bouncing ideas around—it just feels more natural. That’s where the real connections happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the incredible rise of AI technology in recent years, more people than ever before can now create both written and visual content without needing any technological skills. Easily accessible software like ChatGPT, as well as updates to popular image software like Adobe Photoshop, has meant that anyone can create interesting content online.</p>



<p>With this new found accessibility more and more people are using AI to create content for their businesses, blogs and social media. While a lot of use cases are perfectly harmless, there are other cases where AI content is being used for nefarious purposes such as false advertising and spreading fake news.</p>



<p>It’s therefore important that internet users learn how to spot AI content, both written and visual.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spotting-ai-generated-written-content">Spotting AI-Generated Written Content</h2>



<p>Between written and visual content, AI written content is often the hardest to spot. Copying words is easier than copying detailed images and so AI has become pretty good at it. If you’ve ever had a chat with a service like ChatGPT or Bard, you’ll understand just how human they can sound. Even when you talk to companies through their chat systems online such as Amazon or your car insurer, you are more than likely talking, at least initially, to an AI bot.</p>



<p>So how do you spot when you’re reading AI content? Here are some tells to look out for:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Overly Polished and Repetitive Language</li>
</ol>



<p>AI loves using “big” words. If a piece of content is written using AI it’ll use fancy adjectives instead of varying between regular and fancier words, so instead of “the business meeting was <strong>important</strong>” it’ll say “the business meeting was <strong>crucial</strong>”, or instead of “the document still needed <strong>improving</strong>” it’ll write it as “the document still needed <strong>enhancing</strong>”. Obviously these words are in a human writer&#8217;s vocabulary but if a piece of content consistently uses these “bigger” words instead of a more varied vocabulary, then this is a good indication that the article is AI-generated.</p>



<p>As well as that, its use of repetition is actually one of the best ways to spot an AI written piece of content. It loves using “lists of three’s” to describe things, for example, “the dog was big, friendly and happy”. It’ll use this structure over and over again when describing things. So if you’re reading a piece of content where things constantly have three descriptors, then the chances of it being written by an AI are pretty high. Human writers are more likely to vary their sentence structure and length, while this is something that AI doesn’t seem to factor in when writing.</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Lack of Personal Experience or Anecdotes</li>
</ol>



<p>You may not actively notice it when reading a regular human written article but they often have personal experiences, references or anecdotes in them. Perhaps they use a pop culture reference or talk about a relatable situation.</p>



<p>AI struggles with this. It hasn’t had personal experiences and it can’t see the similarities between a situation and a moment from pop culture. If you’re reading a piece of content and it seems very bland and lacking any sort of personality then it could be written by AI.</p>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Perfect Grammar but Unnatural Phrasing</li>
</ol>



<p>AI text will almost always be grammatically flawless, but the phrasing might not be quite right. Certain sayings or words might not be used in quite the right way, a bit like a person who learned a language studying textbooks rather than through natural conversation with other people.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spotting-ai-generated-images-and-videos">Spotting AI-Generated Images and Videos</h2>



<p>While their written text content is very impressive and hard to spot, AI still hasn’t quite got the hang of visual content. There are so many nuances to visual content that we never think about, as to us, that’s just how the world looks, but for AI, perfectly replicating all the little details in visual content is hard to get right.</p>



<p>However, saying that I still scroll through places like Facebook and see plenty of accounts posting AI images with users in the comments believing them to be real. So if you’re struggling to tell real from fake, here are the easiest ways to tell if an image is AI generated:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>General Glitches and Artifacting</li>
</ol>



<p>The biggest tell an image has been created using AI is to check the background. Even if the AI has got the subject of the image correct, it will have taken less notice of the background and smaller details.</p>



<p>As such, their images will often have issues like walls warping into each other, peoples limbs combining together, or even faces looking like they&#8217;re out of a horror film!</p>



<p>Even the subject matter can suffer from this, be it too many limbs on a person or strange and uneven items on cars and buildings. AI makes a lot of mistakes so once you notice one you’ll start seeing more and more.</p>



<p>Take a look at the below photo, how many mistakes can you spot?</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8929" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example-300x300.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example-150x150.webp 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example-768x768.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example-576x576.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example-24x24.webp 24w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example-48x48.webp 48w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example-96x96.webp 96w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<p>The few things that stand out to me straight away are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The cat&#8217;s face is distorted and looks more like a painting than a photo.</li>



<li>The wood panelling on the left behind the sofa mixes with the curtain when it passes behind the lamp.</li>



<li>The frames of the window at the top in the curved section aren’t straight and look like they’ve been drawn on.</li>
</ul>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Inconsistent Facial Features</li>
</ol>



<p>When you think about it human faces are actually very detailed and as such it really struggles with human features. If you’re not sure whether a photo is real, take a look at the face and the body features. Hands having too many fingers or their teeth seeming to blend into one another are easy ways to tell that an image is AI generated.</p>



<p>It also creates faces that have near perfect skin. Even the best looking people in the world have slight imperfections in their faces but AI struggles with these little details and as such AI faces will often have perfect, air-brushed skin that doesn’t look real, making them look a bit like cartoon characters or CGI.</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Unnatural Situations</li>
</ol>



<p>You know how the classic saying goes: “if it looks too good to be true, then it probably is”. The same goes for AI images. If the image you’re looking at seems unbelievable then most likely it isn’t real. You might look at an image of a cat surfing and think “yeah that’s obviously not real” but the amount of people who get fooled by images like that is alarmingly high!</p>



<p>If you’re not sure if something is real, have a quick Google search for the same image or scenario and see if it exists. If it’s real then lots of people will be talking about it, so if you can’t find multiple pictures or articles about it from reputable outlets, it&#8217;s not going to be real.</p>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Lighting That’s Too Perfect</li>
</ol>



<p>A detail that people often overlook in AI images is the lighting. Take a look at the below image:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2000" height="1500" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-real-example.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8951" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-real-example.webp 2000w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-real-example-300x225.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-real-example-1024x768.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-real-example-768x576.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-real-example-1536x1152.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-real-example-576x432.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-real-example-1366x1025.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-real-example-1600x1200.webp 1600w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-real-example-1920x1440.webp 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></figure>



<p>Notice how the shadows of the railings cast on the wall on the left, and how there’s more than one light source (behind camera and from the other room). Natural light is something that AI is currently incapable of properly understanding. Now have another look at this image from earlier that was created by AI:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8929" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example-300x300.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example-150x150.webp 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example-768x768.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example-576x576.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example-24x24.webp 24w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example-48x48.webp 48w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aiarticle-ai-example-96x96.webp 96w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>While it gives it a good go, AI doesn’t understand the nuances of shadows and lighting. It always makes images in high contrast.</p>



<p>It doesn’t take into account the light from the lamp and everything is bathed in this warm yellow sunlight. In reality the light would be much flatter and less colourful with more shadows and dark areas. It’s as if the AI wants you to be able to see all the details in the picture so none of the shadows are dark enough. The bookshelf especially should have a shadow cast on it from the plant that is between it and the light source but doesn’t!</p>



<p>Interestingly, if you were to put this image into Photoshop and average out all the colours it would become just one, bland colour. Whereas doing the same with a real photo would result in more than one colour. This is because AI images, unlike real life images, always have a 50:50 spread of dark and light spots. There is a really interesting video by the YouTube channel Corridor Crew which explains this phenomenon better than I can which you can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/NsM7nqvDNJI?feature=shared&amp;t=827">here</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tools to Help Detect AI Content</h2>



<p>While manual detection is a useful skill to have, being able to get a second opinion is always useful. Here are some tools to check for AI content if you’re still unsure:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>AI Text Content Detectors:</strong> Tools like ZeroGPT and QuillBot are good ways to get an idea of whether something might be AI generated, however, they aren’t perfect. I’ve had pieces of content that these checkers have flagged as being 100% AI despite being written entirely by me. Even this article has sections being flagged as AI despite being 100% written by myself!<br><br>A good rule is if multiple different checkers give a piece of content a score of 50% or more then the chances of that content being AI written, or at least partly AI written, is very high.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Reverse Image Search:</strong> Using Google’s reverse image search is a handy way to check if an image is real or not. If Google comes back with lots of results or even better, different angles of the same subject or event, then you know that the likelihood is high that that image is real.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Deepfake Detectors:</strong> Tools like Deepware and Reality Defender help analyse images and videos for AI creation or manipulation.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>As AI generated content becomes more advanced, distinguishing between human and machine becomes increasingly difficult. However, by paying attention to the details and not taking something on face value you can become more adept at spotting fake content. It’s a skill that might take time to learn, but it’s an important one that all internet users should know.</p>



<p>So the next time you’re reading an article or looking at an image online, take a closer look, you might just uncover an AI’s handiwork.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2025, over <strong>90% of first impressions</strong> of a business are based on its website, and with <strong>75% of users judging a company’s credibility</strong> by its web presence &#8211; according to a Stanford study. Finding the right design agency isn’t just a creative decision &#8211; it’s a commercial one. </p>



<p>Finding the right web partner can be a bit of a minefield—there’s a lot out there, and it’s not always easy to know who actually delivers. To help make the decision a bit easier, we’ve researched and compiled a list of the Top 8 Web Design Agencies in the SA for 2025—based on agencies we know consistently do good work. We’ve selected them based on a few key factors: </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Client Satisfaction:</strong> Verified 5-star reviews and consistent positive client feedback (e.g. on platforms such as Clutch, Google Reviews)</li>



<li><strong>Creativity &amp; Innovation:</strong> Agencies that produce unique, user-focused designs and forward thinking digital experiences.</li>



<li><strong>Expertise &amp; Custom Design</strong>: Teams that go beyond templates and instead build bespoke, high-performing websites tailored to the businesses needs.</li>



<li><strong>Scalability &amp; Flexibility:</strong> Agencies that focus on building digital platforms that are designed to grow alongside a business as time goes by.</li>



<li><strong>Full-Service Capability: </strong>Agencies that also provide additional services such as branding, SEO, UX strategy, hosting and ongoing support.</li>



<li><strong>Industry Recognition:</strong> Agencies that have won awards and are consistently recognised on directories such as Clutch, Sortlist and DesignRush.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-creativeweb">1. CreativeWeb</h3>



<p><strong>Offices: </strong>, Surrey<br><strong>Website:</strong> /<br><strong>Hourly Rate:</strong> £115<br></p>



<p>To begin the list, we have placed ourselves at the top, as both curators of this list and an agency that regularly ranks among the best in the SA, we understand what it takes to create websites that are so much more than simply visually appealing. Here’s a closer look at why Solid.5 leads the way in 2025.</p>



<p>Solid.5 was founded in 2013 by Christopher Baker, a developer-turned-agency-owner with over a decade’s experience in web development and SEO. Since then, the agency has delivered over 500 websites for clients across a range of sectors—including tech, leisure, aviation, corporate, charity, and gaming.</p>



<p>Now a team of 25, we focus on building websites that not only look great but are built to perform—designed and developed entirely in-house, from scratch. No templates. No shortcuts.</p>



<p>We’re proud to be ranked the <strong>No.1 Web Design Agency in the SA and Europe on Clutch</strong>, out of more than 40,000 agencies, which reflects the quality and results we’ve delivered for our clients.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="649" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8941" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-300x190.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-768x487.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-576x365.webp 576w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>We&#8217;re #1 rated on Clutch!</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>We’ve worked with companies like 4media Group, Strata Create, The Social Element, and Infoserv Ltd—handling everything from bespoke site builds to high-performing marketing platforms.</p>



<p>Most of our work is built on WordPress—it gives us the freedom to design and develop sites from the ground up, and clients find it straightforward to use day-to-day. That said, we’re not tied to one setup. We’ve also worked with Shopify, Webflow, and headless CMS platforms like Contentful, Sanity, and Strapi, when the project calls for it. It really comes down to what’s right for the brief.</p>



<p>With accredited standards (ISO certified and a Google Partner), and a background in both design and development, we bring a well-rounded approach to every project—delivering websites that are fast, user-friendly, and built with long-term growth in mind.</p>



<p>In addition to web design and development, we offer other services including branding, SEO, hosting management, digital marketing, and ongoing support, making us a full-service digital partner. We also work with charities and non-profit organisations, supporting great causes pro bono where we can.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-kota">8. Kota</h3>



<p><strong>Offices: </strong>, New York<br><strong>Website: </strong>https://kota.co.SA/<br><strong>Hourly Rate:</strong> £75 &#8211; £115<br></p>



<p>Established in 2013, Kota is a creative agency with offices in  and New York.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re main specialities are in WordPress web design, branding and digital marketing with animated and interactive websites at the heart of what they do. They also offer copywriting and eCommerce solutions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-does-web-design-cost-in-the-SA">How Much Does Web Design Cost in the SA?</h2>



<p>Determining the price of your web design project in the SA can vary depending on your project. Most top agencies prices are between £8,000 to £30,000+ for a custom site and hourly rates, across the industry often range from £80-£150/hr depending on the size, location and expertise of the agency. Check out our<a href="/web-design-cost-estimator/"> Web Design Cost Calculator</a>, which is a quick and easy tool that can help you determine the cost of your project.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-which-web-design-agency-is-right-for-you">Which Web Design Agency is Right for You?</h2>



<p>Choosing the best web design agency for your business is essential for long-term success. Whether you’re looking for a bespoke WordPress site, a focus on interactive experiences, or a design that&#8217;s more conversion-driven, the agencies listed above offer a range of options to help bring your vision to life.</p>



<p>When deciding who to partner with, it’s worth considering a few key points:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Do they offer fully bespoke design, or do they mostly rely on templates?</li>



<li>Is their process transparent, collaborative, and well-structured?</li>



<li>Are their services aligned with your goals, such as branding, SEO, UX, or ongoing support?</li>



<li>Can they show previous work that demonstrates proven results for their clients?</li>



<li>Do they have experience within your sector or with similar industries?</li>
</ul>



<p>When it comes to how to choose the right web design agency in the SA, a good starting point is to review their portfolio &#8211; what they’ve built before, and whether it fits the style or functionality you’re aiming for. There&#8217;s little point hiring a very corporate agency if you’re after something highly creative, for example.</p>



<p>Some agencies are quite flexible and work well across different industries, but it’s still important to find one that feels like a natural fit. Client references and reviews are another strong indicator &#8211; if an agency has plenty of recent, positive feedback, it&#8217;s usually a good sign they&#8217;re consistently delivering quality work. Checking award sites like <a href="https://www.awwwards.com">awwwards.com</a> can also give you a sense of whether their projects stand out.</p>



<p>Budget is another key factor to align early on. Website costs can vary significantly &#8211; anywhere from £5,000 to £35,000+ depending on the project scope &#8211; so it&#8217;s sensible to ensure your expectations match the agency&#8217;s pricing structure. There&#8217;s little point approaching an agency with a £30,000 minimum if your project budget is £10,000.</p>



<p>Taking time to assess these points upfront will give you a much better chance of finding the right long-term partner for your project.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-questions-should-i-ask-a-web-design-agency-before-hiring-them">What questions should I ask a web design agency before hiring them?</h2>



<p>I’d recommend asking about their process &#8211; although once you get to a certain level, most agencies follow fairly similar steps. Some might offer a more agile, intensive approach, while others spread out resources over a longer timeline. It’s worth finding a style that suits how prepared you are.</p>



<p>Timelines are important too: ask about lead times and realistic delivery dates, especially if you have a set launch in mind. Also, be clear about budget early &#8211; it saves everyone&#8217;s time.</p>



<p>Other good things to ask:</p>

<li>Are SEO fundamentals included or extra?</li>



<li>What’s the warranty or support like after the site goes live?</li>



<li>Do you offer ongoing maintenance?</li>



<li>Can you show examples relevant to what I’m looking for (e.g. multilingual sites, interactive designs)?</li>
</ul>



<p>The key is making sure the agency’s experience matches your project&#8217;s goals. Typically, most of these points will also be covered in a good proposal, so providing a clear brief and having an initial call is a good way to start.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-should-i-work-with-a-local-SA-web-design-agency-or-does-location-not-matter">Should I work with a local SA web design agency or does location not matter?</h2>



<p>It depends on what you prefer. Location doesn’t matter technically &#8211; an agency can build your site from anywhere. But after the last few years, a lot of clients prefer the option to meet face-to-face.</p>



<p>Building a website is a partnership &#8211; you’ll need to provide information, give feedback, and work closely with the agency &#8211; so sometimes meeting in person helps build trust.</p>



<p>If you’re happy working remotely and confident in the agency&#8217;s communication, you can work with anyone in the SA. But if you feel more reassured meeting in person, it makes sense to choose someone local.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-can-i-tell-if-a-web-design-agency-will-deliver-a-website-that-performs-well">How can I tell if a web design agency will deliver a website that performs well?</h2>



<p>It really comes down to what you define as &#8220;performs well.&#8221; Start by being clear about your objectives &#8211; whether that’s SEO performance, high interactivity, or excellent user navigation &#8211; and then check whether the agency’s previous work matches those goals.</p>



<p>Look at their case studies, actual live sites they&#8217;ve built, and any performance results they can share. For example, if SEO is critical, look for examples where they’ve delivered strong SEO outcomes.</p>



<p>Once you’re considering good agencies, it often comes down to a mix of cost, expertise in your area, and a general ‘feel’ for who’s the best fit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-it-better-to-choose-a-specialist-web-design-agency-or-a-full-service-digital-agency">Is it better to choose a specialist web design agency or a full-service digital agency?</h2>



<p>If your main goal is to build a high-quality website, I’d recommend a specialist web design agency.</p>



<p>Full-service agencies often offer websites alongside other services like SEO or paid ads, but they might not have the same depth of expertise when it comes to design and development. Specialists typically have a better understanding of what makes a high-performing, brand-consistent site.</p>



<p>Of course, if you have broader marketing needs, a full-service agency could still be a good option &#8211; just bear in mind their focus might be slightly different.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-the-risk-of-choosing-the-wrong-web-design-agency">What’s the risk of choosing the wrong web design agency?</h2>



<p>Choosing the wrong agency can lead to a lot of headaches &#8211; delays, hidden costs, poorly performing websites, or even projects that end up abandoned halfway through.</p>



<p>Most problems we see come from misaligned expectations: often where a project was under-quoted, communication broke down, or the agency over-promised.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to be clear from the start, make sure everything is properly scoped out, and trust your instincts if something feels off.</p>



<p>If you stick to reputable agencies &#8211; like the ones listed on this page &#8211; you’re much less likely to run into problems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Let’s be honest &#8211; there are already a ton of articles on image optimisation. Most of them tell you things you probably already know.</p>



<p>But in building our site recently, despite us being a <a href="/">leading web design agency</a> building over 500 websites in the last 12 years, I found myself in the depths of appeasing Google Speed Insights. Even with my quite vast knowledge on the subject, I ended up discovering and implementing various tactics to sort out our images, get the loading times up to scratch, and do away with those annoying “Properly size images” and “Serve images in modern formats,” etc.</p>



<p>So where to start? Head over here:<a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> https://pagespeed.web.dev/</a>, pop in your website, and if you get any warnings about images in your report, then keep reading on, and let&#8217;s try to sort them out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-types-of-images-nbsp">Types of images&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Ok, so basics first. If you&#8217;re a pro, read on to the next section. However, it&#8217;s always good to have a little refresher.</p>



<p>Different image and graphic types need different formats. If you&#8217;re jamming big JPEGs into your site for everything, you need to stop (collaborate) and listen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jpeg-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8978" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jpeg-1024x683.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jpeg-300x200.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jpeg-768x512.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jpeg-576x384.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jpeg-1366x911.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jpeg.webp 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jpeg-nbsp">Jpeg&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Ok, what does JPEG even mean? Honestly, I use them every day, and I still had to Google this, JPEG stands for:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Joint Photographic Experts Group.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Great, what does that mean though? If you want a guide on the nitty-gritty, head over here:<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/process-of-jpeg-data-compression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/process-of-jpeg-data-compression/</a>, but basically:</p>



<p>JPEG compresses images using lossy compression by transforming the image into frequency components via the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), quantizing the data to reduce precision, and applying entropy coding to efficiently store the remaining information.</p>



<p>Basically, it makes your image much smaller, often with minimal quality loss. Most places where you can save an image from Adobe, Figma, etc., allow you to choose a compression level. I usually go for around 60% unless there is visible quality loss because of this.</p>



<p>Great, so I’ll make all my images JPGs? Well, no-don&#8217;t do that. JPEGs work well for pictures. By pictures, I mean pictures of your offices, pictures of your staff, your holiday photos, pictures of your dog &#8211; that sort of thing.</p>



<p>JPEGs don&#8217;t work well for graphics &#8211; your logos, icons, infographics, flow diagrams, etc. If your logo on your website is a JPEG, you&#8217;re probably noticing it&#8217;s likely a bit blurry and not crisp. Other formats like PNG or SVG work much better for this!</p>



<p>So in summary, if you have an image or something that&#8217;s not a graphic, great-save it as a JPEG, aim for around 60% compression (and size it appropriately-more on this later).</p>



<p><strong>NB:</strong> WebP and, to a lesser extent, AVIF have mostly replaced the need for JPEGs on your site in 2025, so still use them if you have something on-site to sort out delivering WebP from a source file like a JPEG. If you don&#8217;t, then skip ahead to WebP and read on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/png-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8980" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/png-1024x683.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/png-300x200.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/png-768x512.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/png-576x384.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/png-1366x911.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/png.webp 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-png">PNG</h3>



<p>So, PNG-it stands for <strong>Portable Network Graphic</strong> and is a type of raster image file. Again, the nitty-gritty here:<a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/raster/png-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/raster/png-file.html</a>, and a summary:</p>



<p>PNG compresses images using lossless compression by applying filtering to improve redundancy, then encoding the data with the DEFLATE algorithm, which combines LZ77 and Huffman coding for efficient storage without quality loss.</p>



<p>Great, so what should I use a PNG for? Basically, it&#8217;s a good option for a graphic that isn&#8217;t vectored. So if you have your logo, infographic, icon, etc., that isn&#8217;t vectored, a PNG is usually your best option. It allows transparency in the background as well, so you can save, say, your logo on a transparent background. If your header changes colour, no more white block background around your logo.</p>



<p>So you have your logo that isn&#8217;t in a vectored format? (By &#8220;vectored,&#8221; I mean an EPS, AI (no, not ChatGPT or the likes but Adobe AI), or SVG format.) Then a PNG is usually the best way to go.</p>



<p><strong>Top tip:</strong> Put it through this tool &#8211;<a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> https://tinypng.com/</a> &#8211; this is great for reducing the size of your PNG without quality loss before popping it into your site.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gif-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8982" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gif-1024x683.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gif-300x200.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gif-768x512.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gif-576x384.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gif-1366x911.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gif.webp 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gif">GIF</h3>



<p>So, whenever I say this in the office, someone usually tells me it&#8217;s pronounced &#8220;Jif&#8221; with a soft G. There&#8217;s your top tip for saying GIF and sounding like a pro.</p>



<p>It stands for <strong>Graphics Interchange Format</strong>-nitty-gritty:<a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/raster/gif-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/raster/gif-file.html</a>, and a summary:</p>



<p>GIF compresses images using lossless LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) compression, which replaces repeated patterns with shorter codes to reduce file size while supporting a limited 256-color palette.</p>



<p>Great, so when should I use this? Well, I rarely use GIFs-maybe I should use them more, but the problem I find is that GIFs, due to their limited colour profiles, often result in poor &#8211; quality output for more complex graphics. There are also much better options (cough, SVG) that allow for vectored formats so your graphic can resize without losing quality.</p>



<p>So, if you’ve got a simple icon, then a GIF can be a good way to go.</p>



<p><strong>But wait! GIFs do animation.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, they do. You can create animations with GIFs using multiple frames to animate things like your logo.</p>



<p>But if you use a GIF on your website, Google Speed Insights will show you this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeRsA3YOLJ60-e71AtNzwCHlkXfKIzPfDRtGNiw2rEhi1TYraolWjsUyVWkTN6rmLeQBBAutEgbw-dWeeF9pgssi9beDZmJuZBPzhuEkCRPCfRGbzJu2e-sKxBKIxz2DNVJooCQZw?key=JKSZYjPm6C2SpaptClMN2vm4" alt=""/></figure>



<p></p>



<p><strong>“Use video formats for animated content.”</strong></p>



<p>So, as Google says, it&#8217;s not a good way to go. Animated GIFs are usually very big. If you&#8217;re using an animated GIF and don&#8217;t want it to be massive, then use this tool:<a href="https://ezgif.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> https://ezgif.com/</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s pretty good!</p>



<p>Animated GIFs are good for email signatures, but use them on your site, and Big G is not your friend. If you need animation on your site, consider MP4, WebM (if you don&#8217;t care about Mac iOS support), or Lottie (<a href="https://lottiefiles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://lottiefiles.com/</a>).</p>



<p>In summary, GIFs are somewhat of a dated format. We rarely use them on websites unless we have something like a non-vectored icon and a PNG doesn’t make sense. But if you want an animated email signature, GIF is still your friend.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/svg-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8984" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/svg-1024x683.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/svg-300x200.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/svg-768x512.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/svg-576x384.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/svg-1366x911.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/svg.webp 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-svg">SVG</h3>



<p>Ok, we’re getting a bit closer to formats that really matter on a website in 2025.</p>



<p><strong>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.</strong></p>



<p>The guff:<a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/vector/svg-file.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/vector/svg-file.htm</a></p>



<p>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) represents images using XML-based vector paths, defining shapes, lines, and colors mathematically, allowing infinite scalability without loss of quality while remaining editable and lightweight.</p>



<p>So, if you&#8217;re building a site in 2025 and have a graphic, then SVG is your friend. They are great for your logo, icons-pretty much any graphic that isn&#8217;t too large or complex.</p>



<p><strong>Why are they good?</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>They are vectored</strong>, so whether you view them on your 8K gaming monitor or your grandma&#8217;s iPhone 8, they will not lose quality and will scale without loss.</li>



<li><strong>You can embed them!</strong> Unlike other images that require src=&#8221;urltoyourimage&#8221; (unless you&#8217;re doing something like Base64 encoding), embedding SVGs removes the need for extra &#8220;requests&#8221; on your webpage. Too many requests to images or files can slow down your site, and most speed test tools recommend reducing the number of page requests. (Oddly, I don’t believe Google Speed Insights does this, but it still matters as it contributes to a lower speed index.)
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>They are great for use in, say, a logo carousel, where you would normally have 10 requests to different images. If you embed them as SVGs, there are no additional requests.</li>



<li>But be careful! Embedding too many large SVGs can lead to an &#8220;Avoid an excessive DOM size&#8221; warning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="867" height="41" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7417" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed.png 867w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed-300x14.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed-768x36.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed-576x27.png 576w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 867px) 100vw, 867px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>SVGs can put a lot of code on the page.</strong> Google Speed Insights doesn’t like this, so you need to strike a balance between embedding SVGs and including them as standard images.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If you&#8217;re embedding an SVG, this tool is great:<a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/</a>-it optimises your SVG by reducing the amount of code and making them smaller.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>If you embed SVGs, you can apply CSS effects to them.</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Have a big map of the world and want hover effects on a location? SVGs allow you to do this.</li>



<li>Want to apply a gradient or hover effect to your SVG across your site? SVGs allow you to do this.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>They are good for animation.</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In fact, the whole Lottie library (linked previously) is an SVG animation library.</li>



<li>SVGs allow you to create vectored, scalable animations that you can trigger on interaction.</li>



<li>Want your logo or icons to animate when a section comes into view? SVGs can do this-and they’re usually the best option.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>They are easy to work with.</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If you have a design in Figma, you can copy an SVG directly as code and paste it into your site when you&#8217;re developing it.</li>



<li>You don’t have to go through the hassle of exporting, saving, optimising (although using SVGOMG as linked earlier is still a good idea), uploading, referencing the URL, dealing with relative URLs from staging to production, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Where SVGs aren’t so good</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Embedding too many SVGs can create an excessive DOM size.</strong> As mentioned earlier, watch out for this.</li>



<li><strong>Watch out when you have an image inside an SVG.</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>This happens quite often-sometimes an SVG will Base64 encode an image, meaning it won’t actually be vectored or scalable. An SVG imposter!</li>



<li>In these cases, you can end up with a very large SVG that won’t scale properly-so consider using a PNG or another format instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>In Summary</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If you have an icon or non-complex graphic that is vectored, SVG is the way to go.</li>



<li>If you want animation or interactivity with your graphic, use an SVG.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/webp-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8986" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/webp-1024x683.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/webp-300x200.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/webp-768x512.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/webp-576x384.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/webp-1366x911.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/webp.webp 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-webp">WebP</h3>



<p>WebP’s are pretty great-they are a modern format for images and graphics that drastically reduce file size. If you have a website in 2025 and aren&#8217;t using WebP’s, you need to start doing so.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also what Google Speed Insights means when it says <strong>“serving images in modern formats.”</strong> WebP is a modern format, and guess what? Google owns it, and it’s developed by Google-maybe a reason they want you to use it, but credit to Google, they are good.</p>



<p>So, onto a definition of what WebP stands for&#8230; well, it doesn&#8217;t stand for anything-it is simply derived from &#8220;Web Picture.&#8221; I sometimes refer to them as <strong>W</strong>hat <strong>E</strong>ven <strong>B</strong>reaks <strong>P</strong>hotoshop? (since WebP wasn’t natively supported for ages).</p>



<p>Here is a link to Google’s page about WebP:<a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> https://developers.google.com/speed/webp</a></p>



<p>WebP compresses images using predictive coding for lossy compression (similar to VP8 video frames) and dictionary-based techniques for lossless compression, supporting transparency and animation with smaller file sizes than JPEG, PNG, and GIF.</p>



<p>I could go deep into WebP, but basically, if you have a JPEG, PNG, or GIF, then you should convert them to WebP (or AVIF in the next section) and use that instead.</p>



<p><strong>When should you still use a non-WebP image?</strong></p>



<p>The only time you want a non-WebP on your site is if you know your Content Management System (CMS), CDN, or server is converting them for you, and you want conversion and quality handling carried out by that tool. Otherwise, always convert them (or avif, see below)</p>



<p>🚨 <strong>Please don’t use massive JPEGs and PNGs.</strong></p>



<p>In 2025, no one needs a 1.2MB PNG when a 76KB WebP will work just as well. They also support transparency, so that transparent background PNG you&#8217;re using? Make that a WebP too.</p>



<p><strong>How to convert to WebP</strong></p>



<p>This is a great tool for mass converting to WebP: <a href="https://towebp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://towebp.io/</a> There are also some good CDNs and plugins that can handle conversions for you. I’ll go onto that later, along with the pros and cons.</p>



<p><strong>The only downside to WebP?</strong></p>



<p>This is becoming less and less of an issue, but <strong>compatibility.</strong> Check here to see what browsers support them: <a href="https://caniuse.com/webp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://caniuse.com/webp</a></p>



<p>But basically, unless you are developing a website that must support backwards compatibility for outdated browsers (this might be needed for a developing country or because that CEO still thinks IE is the way to go), then WebP is fully safe to use.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-avif">AVIF</h3>



<p>So, AVIF is a modern image format, released in 2019. I say modern, but six years ago isn&#8217;t all that modern in terms of the web.</p>



<p>AVIF stands for AV1 Image File Format, which is based on the <strong>AV1 video codec</strong> and uses the HEIF (High-Efficiency Image File Format) container for storing images with advanced compression.</p>



<p>Our friends over at <strong>Smashing Magazine</strong> have a good article on AVIF and modern file formats: <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/09/modern-image-formats-avif-webp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/09/modern-image-formats-avif-webp/</a></p>



<p><strong>When should you use AVIF, and when should you use WebP?</strong></p>



<p>So, AVIF is a modern image format that Google doesn’t own-if you don&#8217;t like Google, that makes the choice easier.</p>



<p>Basically, AVIF offers better compression and is newer, but WebP is more widely supported.</p>



<p>Check browser support here: <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=avif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://caniuse.com/?search=avif</a></p>



<p>In general, unless you have many older Edge users, AVIF should be safe to use.</p>



<p><strong><em>Quick update on AVIF images – there are two important things to flag that I didn’t mention before.</em></strong></p>



<p>First, AVIFs can be quite resource-heavy to decompress, which means they can slow the browser down a bit, especially if you&#8217;re using a lot of them across your site. Something to keep in mind from a performance perspective.</p>



<p>Second (and more annoyingly), Google doesn&#8217;t really like them. It won’t show AVIFs in search results – for example, when your site shows up on mobile with an image next to it, Google won’t pick up AVIFs for that. It’ll only use WebPs, JPEGs, PNGs, and the like. So even though AVIF offers the best compression and file sizes, I can’t really recommend using them on their own unless you’ve got proper fallbacks in place.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Google controls a huge chunk of the internet and marketing visibility, so WebP tends to be a better all-round option unless you’re happy to go the extra mile with fallbacks.</p>



<p><strong>Is AVIF better than WebP?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, in real-time usage, AVIF is better-so really, in 2025, you should be using it and could even argue for it over WebP.</p>



<p>However, WebP has better support in design software (only recently with Adobe), whereas AVIF isn’t really a format you see when exporting an image from Adobe, Figma, or similar tools.</p>



<p>This is because:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>AVIF takes longer to encode and decode</li>



<li>It’s more resource-intensive, especially on older hardware</li>



<li>The uptake in design software is low</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Compression: AVIF vs WebP</strong></p>



<p>AVIF <strong>can offer 30-50% better compression</strong> than WebP.</p>



<p>That’s a big saving, but note that this is compound compression.</p>



<p>If you’ve already saved 900KB by converting a JPEG to WebP, you’re probably thinking:<br><em>&#8220;That’ll do-massive saving!&#8221;</em></p>



<p>At this point, the need to take one step further and optimise might get lost, especially if you&#8217;re already meeting Google Speed Insights’ requirements.</p>



<p>Example Calculation:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Starting with a 1MB JPEG</li>



<li>Converted to WebP at 100KB (90% smaller than JPEG)</li>



<li>AVIF is 30-50% smaller than WebP, so:</li>
</ul>



<p>At 30% smaller:<br>100KB × 0.70 = 70KB</p>



<p>At 50% smaller:<br>100KB × 0.50 = 50KB</p>



<p>That extra 30-50KB saving over the compatibility of AVIF often gets overlooked.</p>



<p><strong>In Summary</strong></p>



<p>✅ Yes, you should be using AVIF.</p>



<p>Its support is now almost as wide as WebP, it saves more file size, and it has all the same features (including transparency) as WebP.</p>



<p>So, if you’ve already converted to WebP, go one step further and use this to convert to AVIF: <a href="https://towebp.io/webp-to-avif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://towebp.io/webp-to-avif</a></p>



<p><strong>Image File Types Summary</strong></p>



<p>In short: stop using JPEGs, PNGs, and GIFs unless you&#8217;re handling image conversion at the CDN, server, or CMS level.</p>



<p>There is now good and wide support for modern file formats like WebP and AVIF-there’s no good reason not to use them on a website.</p>



<p>The file size savings are massive, and you’re not going to achieve a good score on Google Speed Insights unless you’re using these formats.</p>

<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-image-sizing">Image sizing</h2>



<p>Ok we’ve got your file types sorted. You’ve gone into your site, switched all your jpegs, pngs and gifs to webp or avif, we should be good right?</p>



<p>Not that easy, Google Speed Insights might still be giving you this warning:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXemJo8ePlZ2TYyw4oaTGi0Xm0vuu8366UVmhvndaAGaBu89iVecNU5ameZ_rT6XHDRgh9GDmcjBmcpoOFwzArCDm9IPsCOZezm7ccUEZ3bUqKUroao-tnTSg2AvIi_3pmneLxtO?key=JKSZYjPm6C2SpaptClMN2vm4" alt=""/></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Properly size images&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we’ve saved loads of space converting them to the right format, but if your image is still 2000px width and is being rendered in a 300px frame then there is still optimization that can take place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this point the most logical thing to do would be to resize your image to 300px. Yes thats right, but we live in a time of responsive web design, no more fixed width container divs (minus 60px for the scroll bar) or websites built in tables. Your 300px resized image is good for a desktop screen size (above around 1200px) but on mobile its likely rendering smaller, lets say 100px.</p>



<p>So what do you do here? This is where srcsets come in:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Srcsets</strong></p>



<p>The Guff: srcset is an HTML attribute that lets you define multiple versions of the same image at different widths (e.g., 400w, 800w, 1200w). The browser uses this list, along with the sizes attribute, to choose the most appropriate image based on the device’s screen size and resolution. It helps reduce file size and improves loading speed without sacrificing image quality.</p>



<p>So in summary It lets the browser choose from different image sizes depending on the screen size and resolution. Saves bandwidth, improves speed, and stops Google Speed Insights moaning about properly sized images.</p>



<p>Here’s a basic comparison:</p>



<p><strong>Standard image tag:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Example image"&gt;</code></pre>



<p></p>



<p><strong>With </strong><strong>srcset</strong><strong>:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&lt;img src="image-800.jpg"&nbsp;srcset="image-400.jpg 400w, image-800.jpg 800w, image-1200.jpg 1200w"&nbsp;&nbsp;sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 1200px) 800px, 1200px"&nbsp;alt="Example image"&gt;</code></pre>



<p></p>



<p>What this means:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>srcset tells the browser which versions of the image are available.</li>



<li>sizes tells it how wide the image will be at different breakpoints.</li>



<li>The browser picks the best one based on screen size and resolution.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Sounds good, but writing that for every image is a pain-cropping, resizing, writing markup-it’s not realistic for most builds. Which is why this is usually handled at the CMS level.</p>



<p>In WordPress, if you’re using wp_get_attachment_image() or the_post_thumbnail(), it should be doing this for you automatically.</p>



<p>Example:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&lt;?php echo wp_get_attachment_image( $image_id, 'full' ); ?&gt;</code></pre>



<p></p>



<p>That’ll output the full srcset and sizes for you. As long as you’re using WordPress’s built-in image functions, it’s already sorted.</p>



<p>In React (Next.js), use the built-in &lt;Image /&gt; component:</p>



<p>import Image from &#8216;next/image&#8217;;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&lt;Image&nbsp;src="/images/example.jpg"&nbsp;alt="Example image" width={1200}&nbsp;&nbsp;height={800}&nbsp;sizes="(max-width:600px) 400px, (max-width: 1200px) 800px, 1200px" /&gt;</code></pre>



<p></p>



<p>In Vue (Nuxt):</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&lt;NuxtImg&nbsp;src="/images/example.jpg"&nbsp;sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 1200px) 800px, 1200px"&nbsp;alt="Example image"&nbsp;/&gt;</code></pre>



<p></p>



<p>If you’re not using a framework that handles this, you’ll need to do it manually-or look at a CDN to help out (we’ll come onto that shortly).</p>



<p><strong>WordPress tip:</strong><br>Sometimes WordPress’s auto-generated srcset and sizes aren’t ideal. You might find it defaults to things like sizes=&#8221;auto&#8221; or serves weird image breakpoints. If that’s the case, you can define your own image sizes in functions.php:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>function cbd_register_custom_image_sizes()
{
  add_image_size('mobile', 576);
  add_image_size('large-mobile', 768);
  add_image_size('tablet', 1024);
  add_image_size('small-laptop', 1366);
  add_image_size('medium-laptop', 1600);
  add_image_size('full-width', 1920);
}
add_action('after_setup_theme', 'cbd_register_custom_image_sizes');

function cbd_custom_image_sizes_dropdown($sizes)
{
  return array_merge($sizes, array(
    'mobile'        =&gt; __('Mobile (576px)'),
    'large-mobile'  =&gt; __('Large Mobile (768px)'),
    'tablet'        =&gt; __('Tablet (1024px)'),
    'small-laptop'  =&gt; __('Small Laptop (1366px)'),
    'medium-laptop' =&gt; __('Medium Laptop (1600px)'),
    'full-width'    =&gt; __('Full Width (1920px)')
  ));
}
add_filter('image_size_names_choose', 'cbd_custom_image_sizes_dropdown');
</code></pre>



<p></p>



<p>This will give you more control over how WordPress handles your image breakpoints and what gets added to the srcset.</p>



<p>Summary:<br>If you’ve sorted your srcsets, your images should now be correctly sized across devices, and that “Properly size images” warning in Google Speed Insights should be gone.</p>



<p>Now we’ll go on to look at some other techniques that can help-like CDNs, lazy loading, and delivery optimisation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/lazy-loading-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8990" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/lazy-loading-1024x683.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/lazy-loading-300x200.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/lazy-loading-768x512.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/lazy-loading-576x384.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/lazy-loading-1366x911.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/lazy-loading.webp 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lazy-loading">Lazy loading</h2>



<p>Okay, so you’ve done your srcsets, you’ve got your images in the right formats, everything’s looking good—and now you’re getting hit with <em>“Defer off-screen images”</em>, like the screenshot below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc-LbPxJ0uxMqeWMVtAkDhvArrQ1StEfSIKCKJibYtnrTXI5KQ_Jq4t8-g05MOp1P-chTVwjpw5XyW4rTUT_oF9NiE7twY48t8I0Jf3iCQIE5IPt_VvwMtG5PSQJAyaNVY0_5Go?key=JKSZYjPm6C2SpaptClMN2vm4" alt=""/></figure>



<p></p>



<p>What does this actually mean, and how do you fix it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can see Google is suggesting you consider lazy loading, so let’s go into what that actually is.</p>



<p>So, what is lazy loading?</p>



<p>In technical terms, lazy loading is a browser-level optimisation that defers loading of off-screen resources (like images) until they’re about to enter the viewport. Instead of requesting all assets as the page initially loads, the browser holds off on fetching anything marked with loading=&#8221;lazy&#8221; until it&#8217;s needed. This reduces unused data transfer, speeds up time to first paint, and lowers your LCP score in tools like Google Speed Insights.</p>



<p>Lazy loading works by using the native loading attribute on &lt;img&gt; and &lt;iframe&gt; elements. It’s supported by most modern browsers and doesn&#8217;t require any JavaScript or external libraries to use in basic cases.</p>



<p>Here’s the guff:<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>Without lazy loading:</p>



<p>&lt;img src=&#8221;example.jpg&#8221; alt=&#8221;An example image&#8221;&gt;<br><br></p>



<p><p>With lazy loading:</p></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&lt;img src="example.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="An example image"&gt;
</code></pre>



<p></p>



<p>&nbsp;What this does: it tells the browser not to load that image straight away. It’ll only fetch it when the user scrolls close enough for it to actually matter. Saves bandwidth, speeds things up, and stops Google from shouting at you about deferring off-screen images.</p>



<p>The markup is pretty easy. You basically just add loading=&#8221;lazy&#8221; to your image tag.</p>



<p>In WordPress, this is handled for you in most cases—you can just include lazy loading as an option, and it’ll do the rest. Same goes for React or Vue. It’s pretty straightforward, so you don’t need me to walk you through that bit.</p>



<p>However—you don’t want to lazy load <em>everything</em>.</p>



<p>If you’ve got images that are needed on first load (like anything in your hero section), lazy loading them can actually cause more problems. You might end up with layout shifts or missing images on first render, and Google Speed Insights might start complaining about things like render-blocking or content not appearing fast enough.</p>



<p>So, general rule of thumb: Lazy load anything <em>below the fold</em>.<br>Don’t lazy load images that are needed for the first view of the page.</p>



<p><strong>Native lazy loading vs JavaScript fallback:<br></strong> Most modern browsers support native lazy loading with loading=&#8221;lazy&#8221;, but if you need to support older browsers (looking at you, Internet Explorer or older Safari), you might consider a JavaScript fallback like<a href="https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> lazysizes</a>. For most people in 2025, though, this is overkill.</p>



<p><strong>Preloading key images:</strong><br>If you&#8217;re not lazy loading a hero image or anything above the fold, and it&#8217;s critical to the visual load, consider preloading it to prioritise it:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&lt;link rel="preload" as="image" href="hero.jpg"&gt;</code></pre>



<p></p>



<p>This can help boost LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) if that image is a big part of your page’s first impression.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cdn-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8992" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cdn-1024x683.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cdn-300x200.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cdn-768x512.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cdn-576x384.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cdn-1366x911.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cdn.webp 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cdn-s">CDN’s</h2>



<p>Okay, so now we’re on to CDNs.</p>



<p>So what is a CDN?</p>



<p>It stands for Content Delivery Network. It’s a network of servers around the world that deliver your website’s files—images, scripts, stylesheets, that sort of thing—from the closest location to the user. This reduces latency and improves load times.</p>



<p>Here’s the guff on it if you want the deeper explanation: <a href="https://www.akamai.com/glossary/what-is-a-cdn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://www.akamai.com/glossary/what-is-a-cdn</a></p>



<p>CDNs are generally a good thing to use on your website. They help load your content from different locations around the world, so it’s usually delivered faster. Say your server is in  and someone loads your site in New York,a CDN might have a server location much closer to them, so instead of waiting for everything to come from , they get it quicker from a nearby server.</p>



<p>So they help speed up your website, which is great—but they can also do all sorts of things with your images. And that’s why I’m bringing them up here.</p>



<p>So at this point, you may have got down to this part of the guide—who knows, you might’ve got fed up by now—but you’re probably thinking, <em>this is a lot of effort, isn’t it?</em> I’ve got to convert all my formats, I’ve got to do srcsets, I’ve got to fiddle around with sizes and compression and all sorts. This seems like a right faff.</p>



<p>Is there not a better way?</p>



<p>And yes—there is. In some cases, you can just use a CDN, and it’ll sort a lot of it for you.</p>



<p>There are pros and cons to doing it this way, and I’ll go through the two CDNs that we use, explain how they work, and what the pros and cons are. But yes, there is a faster way.</p>



<p><strong>Cloudflare&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Cloudflare is great. If you&#8217;re not using it, you probably should be. It does your DNS, handles security, and acts as a solid CDN. I&#8217;m not going to go into all the ins and outs of what Cloudflare can do—there’s loads of guff on their site if you want that. Here’s the link:<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> https://www.cloudflare.com</a></p>



<p>What I will go into is Cloudflare’s image optimisation—because this is where it gets useful for what we’re doing here.</p>



<p>There are two things worth knowing: Polish and Image Resizing.</p>



<p>Polish is Cloudflare’s automatic compression tool. It strips out metadata like EXIF data, compresses your images (you can choose lossy or lossless), and if the browser supports it, it’ll automatically convert and serve WebP. This all happens on the edge, so it doesn&#8217;t mess with the original image on your server. It just delivers a much smaller version when someone loads the site.</p>



<p>Image Resizing is the clever one. Instead of you having to create ten different sizes of every image and build your own srcset, you can just give Cloudflare a high-res version, and it’ll resize it on the fly. You can literally define the width and height in the image URL. So you might end up with something like:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&lt;img src="/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,height=200/your-image.jpg" alt="Example image"&gt;</code></pre>



<p></p>



<p>That tells Cloudflare to resize your image to 300&#215;200 before serving it. It works well with srcset too, so you can still give the browser a few options if you want to. Saves you from doing all the cropping and exporting manually.</p>



<p>So yeah—Cloudflare doesn’t just speed things up, it can also take a lot of the image optimisation hassle off your plate. Worth looking into if you’re not already using it.</p>



<p>The only thing I will say about Cloudflare’s Polish is that, in real-world usage, the compression isn’t that extreme. So for example, I might upload a PNG to the site—it could be, say, 300 or 400KB—and when I download it from the front end with Cloudflare enabled, it’s still 300 or 400KB. No real difference.</p>



<p>Even after fiddling with the settings, Polish will often tell me that image is as optimised as it can be and that there’s no benefit to converting it to WebP. But in reality, if I take that same PNG and run it through a manual tool and convert it to a WebP—or even better, to AVIF—I can usually save a massive amount of space.</p>



<p>So, same example: upload a 400KB PNG, Polish says it’s good to go. But if I convert that to AVIF manually, I can usually get that down to under 100KB. That’s a 300KB saving, and a pretty big one if you’re doing that across loads of images.</p>



<p>So yeah—Cloudflare Polish and Image Resizing are good, and I love Cloudflare generally, but if you really care about compression, especially on heavy pages, you’ll still get better results using manual tools to convert to AVIF or WebP before uploading.</p>



<p>So yeah—Cloudflare is great, and you should be using it. But I wouldn’t say its image optimisation tools are enough to just switch on and be done with it:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You still need to lazy load.</li>



<li>You still need to change your markup if you want to use image resizing properly.</li>



<li>Polish is decent, but it’s not enough on its own—you’ll probably still get warnings in your speed test tools.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’ve got Cloudflare and you can enable these features, then yes—absolutely use them. But manual optimisation will still give you better results every time.</p>



<p><strong>Ewww</strong></p>



<p>The last one I’ll mention is EWWW.</p>



<p>It might be relatively unknown, but it’s a very good tool—and it works well with WordPress. If you’re looking for an all-round solution and you’re not particularly technical, this is a solid option. You can install it on your site, check a few boxes, and it’ll handle a lot of the heavy lifting for you. It comes with loads of features, including automatic srcset injection, lazy loading, format conversion, and CDN delivery. You can tweak the settings, turn things on or off, and generally get decent optimisation without much effort.</p>



<p>The only thing I’ll say is that it <em>can</em> cause conflicts. So depending on your setup, you might run into issues—things like JavaScript errors if it tries to lazy load something it shouldn’t, or even images going blurry no matter what settings you pick. It can be frustrating to get to the bottom of if that happens.</p>



<p><strong>So I’d say: </strong>If you’ve got a site that’s already been built and image optimisation wasn’t thought about properly at the time, EWWW is a good way to go back and patch it in.<br>If you’re building a new site and you know what you’re doing, I’d lean more towards doing it manually. You’ll get better results and more control.</p>



<p>That being said, it’s a very good tool—and it plays nicely with things like WP Rocket and Cloudflare, so you can stack it with other optimisers to really speed your site up.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-notes-amp-summary">Final Notes &amp; Summary</h3>



<p>So, in summary—image optimisation is one of those things that sounds simple at first but ends up being more effort than you&#8217;d expect. And while there are tools that can help (and you should use them), you still need to understand what’s going on behind the scenes.</p>



<p>Here’s the quick version:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Use modern formats like WebP or AVIF wherever you can.<br></li>



<li>Resize your images to fit the actual size they’re being rendered at—don’t just chuck in a 2000px-wide image because it “looks better”.<br></li>



<li>Use srcset to let the browser choose the right size based on the screen.<br></li>



<li>Lazy load anything that’s not needed on first load—but don’t lazy load above-the-fold stuff.<br></li>



<li>CDNs like Cloudflare or EWWW can save you time and fix bad habits—but they won’t fix everything.<br></li>



<li>Manual optimisation will always give you the best results—but yes, it’s more work.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>If you&#8217;re building a new site, get this right from the start. If you&#8217;re fixing an old one, tools like EWWW and Cloudflare can get you most of the way there.</p>



<p>And one last point—test everything. Run your site through Google Speed Insights or Lighthouse and check the results after every change. What looks good in theory doesn&#8217;t always translate into a faster site in practice.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s it. Hopefully, this has been useful—or at the very least, helped you avoid a few of the rabbit holes I ended up going down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2025, web design is much more than just a good looking site, instead it is more about functionality, accessibility, and immersive user experiences. Technology is evolving at an extremely fast rate and staying ahead of the game is crucial if you are wanting to stand out. That&#8217;s why more and more people are looking at using <a href="/">leading web design</a> agencies for their websites.</p>



<p>Here are our top 8 web design trends to consider following for your next web design project:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-sustainable-web-design-nbsp">1. Sustainable Web Design&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The internet might seem as though it is not really there, but it has a very real environmental impact (<a href="/website-design/sustainable-website-design-tips/">Read more on this here</a>). So much so that it contributes to around 4% of global carbon emissions (<em>yes, the internet pollutes more than planes!)</em> So while you are busy travelling, your website could be accumulating its own carbon footprint! As businesses become more conscious of the impact web sites can have on the environment, sustainable web design is taking centre stage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="572" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/websitecarbon-example-1024x572.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8996" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/websitecarbon-example-1024x572.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/websitecarbon-example-300x167.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/websitecarbon-example-768x429.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/websitecarbon-example-1536x857.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/websitecarbon-example-2048x1143.webp 2048w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/websitecarbon-example-576x321.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/websitecarbon-example-1366x762.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/websitecarbon-example-1600x893.webp 1600w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/websitecarbon-example-1920x1072.webp 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Using a carbon calculator like websitecarbon.com is a great way to tell how sustainable your current website is. (Our site for NATO Innovation Fund gets an A rating!)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>How can web design be more sustainable?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>By Limiting Video Content:</strong> Video content is one of the largest energy consuming factors on the internet. There are different ways to reduce this on your website by limiting unnecessary videos, turning autoplay off and hosting externally through the likes of YouTube or Vimeo, which can all significantly lower your site’s carbon footprint.</li>



<li><strong>By Optimising &amp; Compressing Images</strong>: Try and use less images especially those that are not very well optimised and take forever to load. Compression tools such as <a href="https://ewww.io/">EWWW Image Optimiser</a> can significantly cut down energy consumption.</li>



<li><strong>By Switching to Renewables</strong>: Through choosing a web hosting provider that is green and powered by renewable energy, you can significantly increase your site&#8217;s sustainability.</li>



<li><strong>By Cleaning &amp; Minifying Your Code</strong>: You will see enhanced performance all around, through removing any unnecessary code, minimising CSS and JavaScript, as well as reducing third-party scripts.</li>
</ul>



<p>As well as helping the planet, sustainable web design also improves page speed, enhances SEO rankings, and reduces costs. Users love fast, efficient sites, and Google rewards them too.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-micro-interactions-amp-micro-animations">2. Micro-Interactions &amp; Micro-Animations</h2>



<p>Micro-interactions and micro-animations are taking up a lot of space in the web design world, through subtle design elements that bring websites to life. Here’s the difference between the two:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Micro-interactions</strong> provide instant feedback, like a button changing colour when clicked or a form shaking when there is an error.</li>



<li><strong>Micro-animations</strong> create smooth transitions, guiding users attention and making interactions feel seamless.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay loop muted src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/fairvue-loadscreen-example-720.mp4" playsinline></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The <a href="/portfolio/fairvue-partners/">Fairvue Partners</a> website uses an engaging animation of their logo as the loading screen.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Where are we seeing this?</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&nbsp;<strong>Hover effects</strong>: Buttons that change colour or grow slightly when hovered over.</li>



<li>&nbsp;<strong>Scroll-triggered animations</strong>: Elements that fade in or slide as users move down the page.</li>



<li>&nbsp;<strong>Loading animations</strong>: These keep users engaged whilst content loads.</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal of these is not just to look good, it is also to enhance usability, increase engagement, and make websites feel more intuitive.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-scrolling-animations-amp-dynamic-page-transitions">3. Scrolling Animations &amp; Dynamic Page Transitions</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay loop muted src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/soapbox-scroll-example-720.mp4" playsinline></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The Soapbox home page is a great example of a dynamic and engaging scroll animation. As the user scrolls the VR headset turns around and they are taken inside the headset.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Static websites are a design style from the past, going forward it is all about scroll-triggered animations, dynamic transitions, and fluid interactions that transform the way users experience a website. Instead of just clicking page to page, visitors are now taken on a journey as they scroll.</p>



<p><strong>Ways to create scrolling animations and dynamic page transitions:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Parallax scrolling</strong>: This involves background images that move at different speeds, adding depth and storytelling elements.</li>



<li><strong>Seamless page transitions</strong>: Instead of abrupt reloads, pages can fade or slide into one another for a smoother experience.</li>



<li><strong>Interactive scroll-based navigation</strong>: Users feel more in control as elements shift dynamically based on movement.</li>



<li><strong>Cinematic effects</strong>: Layered visuals, zoom effects, and motion-triggered elements bring a more immersive feel.</li>
</ul>



<p>These effects improve user engagement, make navigation feel intuitive, and very importantly encourage visitors to stay longer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-immersive-experiences-with-3d-amp-ar">4. Immersive Experiences with 3D &amp; AR</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay loop muted src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bmw-360-example-720.mp4" playsinline></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Auto manufacturers like BMW use interact-able 360 views for when you&#8217;re speccing a car.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Through 3D elements and Augmented Reality (AR), websites are enabling immersive experiences, where users can explore, interact, and engage with content in ways that appear very close to a real life experience.</p>



<p><strong>How is this transforming web design?</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&nbsp;<strong>E-commerce:</strong> Virtual try-ons and 3D product previews let shoppers see how items look before buying, an example like you see below is <a href="https://demo.deepar.ai/ads/new/nike/">Nike’s AR sneakers</a> or <a href="https://www.ikea.com/global/en/newsroom/innovation/ikea-launches-ikea-place-a-new-app-that-allows-people-to-virtually-place-furniture-in-their-home-170912/">IKEA’s virtual furniture placement</a>.</li>



<li>&nbsp;<strong>Real estate &amp; travel:</strong> 360° property tours and interactive maps are helping users explore spaces before booking, with brands like Airbnb leading the way.</li>



<li>&nbsp;<strong>Branded storytelling:</strong> Companies are using interactive 3D visuals to show off products with 360° views, making online shopping even more engaging.</li>



<li>&nbsp;<strong>Gaming &amp; entertainment:</strong> Web-based 3D experiences powered by WebGL and AI-generated models run smoothly in browsers, bringing game-like interactivity to websites.</li>
</ul>



<p>With WebXR, AR-enabled browsers, and AI-powered 3D models, these high-quality visuals no longer slow down websites, making interactive experiences faster, more accessible, and more effective than ever.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-dark-mode-evolution">5. Dark Mode Evolution</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay loop muted src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sidcup-darkmode-example-720.mp4" playsinline></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The <a href="/portfolio/sidcup-golf/">Sidcup Family Golf</a> site has a modern design that uses a contrasting black and green colour scheme.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Dark mode has now become a prominent feature with websites offering adaptive dark mode options, allowing users to switch based on preference or system settings.</p>



<p><strong>Why dark mode is not going anywhere:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Better for you</strong>: It is easier on the eyes, especially in low-light conditions.</li>



<li><strong>Energy efficient</strong>: OLED and AMOLED screens consume less power in dark mode.</li>



<li><strong>Modern aesthetics</strong>: It makes websites look modern and sleek.</li>
</ul>



<p>In 2025, we are seeing intelligent dark mode that automatically adjusts based on user behaviour, time of day, or ambient lighting conditions.</p>



<p>Example: YouTube and Twitter/X both offer dark mode options, reducing screen glare and improving the user experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-responsive-amp-adaptive-design">6. Responsive &amp; Adaptive Design</h2>



<p>Forget mobile-first, websites in 2025 need to work seamlessly on any device. From smartphones and laptops to foldable screens and smart TVs, modern web design is all about adapting dynamically to both screen size and user behaviour.</p>



<p><strong>Key innovations include:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>AI-driven layouts</strong>: Websites that adjust layouts on the fly based on user preferences and behaviour.</li>



<li><strong>Variable fonts</strong>: Enhancing readability across different devices and screen sizes.</li>



<li><strong>Smart breakpoints</strong>: Optimising UI for everything from foldable phones to car dashboards.</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal of this is to create an experience for users that is more seamless.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay loop muted src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gibraltar-adaptivedesign-example-720.mp4" playsinline></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Modern websites have to be responsive and adaptive and the site for the <a href="/portfolio/gibraltar-nature-reserve/">Gibraltar Nature Reserve</a> is no different.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-personalised-content-powered-by-ai-nbsp">7. Personalised Content Powered by AI&nbsp;</h2>



<p>AI-driven personalisation is making web experiences smarter and completely tailored to individual users through analysing user behaviour, preferences, and past interactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How is AI personalising the web?</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Dynamic content recommendations:</strong> Websites now track everything from browsing habits, purchase history, and user interests to suggest relevant articles, products, or videos.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>AI-powered chatbots &amp; virtual assistants:</strong> These are no longer the basic and scripted bots; Advanced AI-driven chatbots learn from previous conversations and provide personalised support.</li>



<li><strong>Adaptive landing pages:</strong> AI adjusts headlines, CTAs, and visuals based on where a user is in their buying journey. For example as a first time visitor, you might see an introductory offer but if you are a recurring customer you would instead perhaps see a ‘Welcome Back’ message.</li>



<li><strong>Predictive UX:</strong> AI can now anticipate user needs through analysing real-time behaviour, which is particularly useful if someone is about to abandon their cart then they will be sent a discount offer to entice conversion.</li>
</ul>



<p>As AI continues to evolve and integrate with machine learning, expect hyper-personalised web experiences to become the new normal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-voice-user-interfaces-vuis">8. Voice User Interfaces (VUIs)</h2>



<p>Voice search and smart assistants are becoming part of everyday life, meaning websites need to also integrate them to stay relevant.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Here is how VUIs are changing web design:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Talking instead of typing</strong>: So, instead of clicking through menus, users can directly ask questions or give voice commands to find what they need from a website.</li>



<li><strong>Voice-friendly SEO</strong>: If websites integrate this, this means that sites need to optimise content for how people speak in everyday life, using conversational, question-based queries.</li>



<li>&nbsp;<strong>Hands-free browsing</strong>: This is perfect for an eCommerce site to help and convert multitaskers, busy shoppers, and those who rely on accessibility features.</li>



<li><strong>Voice-powered shopping</strong>: This means you can add products to your cart or check out with just a quick command with no scrolling or clicking, again really great for eCommerce sites.</li>
</ul>



<p>AI-powered assistants such as Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri are getting smarter and VUIs will over time change the way we interact with websites, making browsing a lot faster and easier.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-thoughts-the-future-of-web-design-nbsp">Final Thoughts: The Future of Web Design&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Web design in 2025 is all about smarter, more immersive, and user-first experiences. Whether it’s sustainability, AI-driven personalisation, or interactive 3D elements, the brands that stay ahead of the curve will be the ones that stand out. The digital world is evolving fast &#8211; if your website feels outdated, slow, or uninspired, now’s the time to level up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SEO in 2025 is more intelligent, more competitive, and moving faster than ever. Whether you’re just getting started or fine-tuning an existing strategy, a clear, well-structured approach is essential to boosting your visibility and attracting consistent organic traffic.</p>



<p>A strong SEO strategy isn’t just about ranking higher, it’s about getting discovered by the right people at the right time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s break it down into six actionable steps to help build an SEO strategy that <em>actually</em> works in 2025.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-step-1-research-research-research">Step 1: Research, Research, Research</h2>



<p>Before you dive into optimising your website, you need to understand the digital landscape. Research is the foundation of a strong SEO strategy. Without it, you’re essentially throwing darts in the dark and hoping for the best.</p>



<p>The first step? Sizing up the competition. Take a look at who’s already ranking for the keywords you’ve got your eye on. What kind of content are they putting out there? Is it in-depth guides, listicles, landing pages? Tools like <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7337243?hl=en">Google Keyword Planner</a>, <a href="https://ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a>, or <a href="https://www.semrush.com/">SEMrush</a> will give you insight into high-value keywords with good search volume and reasonable competition.</p>



<p>But it’s not just about keywords, it’s also important to consider search intent. Google’s search results pages (SERPs) are structured based on user expectations. Are your target keywords triggering blog posts, product pages, or local listings? Understanding this tells you exactly how to structure your content for the best results.</p>



<p>Once you understand search intent, look for gaps in existing content. If key topics aren’t well covered, that’s your chance to create something more useful — and become the result people actually want to find.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="721" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/competitor-gap-seo-1024x721.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8999" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/competitor-gap-seo-1024x721.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/competitor-gap-seo-300x211.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/competitor-gap-seo-768x540.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/competitor-gap-seo-576x405.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/competitor-gap-seo.webp 1259w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>This Competitor Content Gap chart highlights keyword opportunities by comparing your site’s rankings against competitors, helping prioritise SEO efforts to boost visibility.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Understand Your Audience &amp; Search Intent</h2>



<p>Ranking well is great — but if that traffic isn’t turning into leads or sales, what’s the point?</p>



<p>That’s where user intent comes into play. Every search query falls into one of three categories:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Informational intent</strong> – Users want answers (e.g., “How does SEO work?”). Perfect for blogs and guides.</li>



<li><strong>Navigational intent</strong> – They’re looking for a specific brand or website (e.g., “Nike running shoes site”).</li>



<li><strong>Transactional intent</strong> – These are the moneymakers. People are ready to buy (e.g., “best price for iPhone 15”).</li>
</ul>



<p>If your content doesn’t match search intent, Google won’t rank it—and users won’t click on it. Google is also doubling down on Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T), so your content needs to be credible, helpful, and written by experts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 3: Mobile-First Everything</h2>



<p>If your site doesn’t work seamlessly on mobile, you’re likely already behind. Google made mobile-first indexing the norm back in 2019, and that hasn’t changed in 2025.</p>



<p>On top of that, speed matters more than ever — a sluggish site doesn’t just annoy visitors, it can seriously hurt your search rankings.</p>



<p>Your goal? A Google PageSpeed score of 90+. Beyond that, your site needs to be fully responsive, meaning users shouldn’t have to pinch and zoom to navigate. Google’s Core Web Vitals are still a major ranking factor, so keep an eye on metrics like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).</p>



<p>If you’re unsure how your site performs on mobile, tools like <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2017/01/introducing-mobile-friendly-test-api">Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test</a> and <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">PageSpeed Insights</a> can give you a full breakdown.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 4: Leverage Structured Data (Schema Markup)</h2>



<p>Structured data, or schema markup, is one of the most underrated SEO strategies, yet it can dramatically boost your presence in search results. It helps Google understand your content and display it in rich results, which can mean higher click-through rates and more traffic.</p>



<p>Ever seen search results with star ratings, FAQs, or event listings? That’s structured data in action. If you’re not using it yet, now’s the time to start. <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data">Google’s Structured Data Testing Tool </a>can help ensure your schema markup is working correctly.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-step-5-build-high-quality-backlinks-the-right-way">Step 5: Build High-Quality Backlinks (The Right Way)</h2>



<p>What happens off your site is just as important as what’s on it. Backlinks are still a major ranking factor, but the old tricks, like spammy link farms, don’t cut it anymore. In 2025, it’s all about earning genuine, high-quality links from reputable sources that actually trust your content.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Guest posting still works &#8211; but only when done ethically. Writing valuable content for reputable sites in your industry can generate backlinks that boost your domain authority.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Digital PR is another great strategy &#8211; getting featured in news articles or industry publications can drive real, long-term SEO benefits.</li>
</ul>



<p>And then there’s broken link building &#8211; where you find outdated links on high-authority sites and suggest your content as a better alternative. Smart, effective, and very Google-approved.</p>



<p>💡 Pro Tip: Use Ahrefs or Moz to track your backlink profile and eliminate backlinks that could harm your ranking.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="395" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/organic-clicks-seo-1024x395.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-9004" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/organic-clicks-seo-1024x395.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/organic-clicks-seo-300x116.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/organic-clicks-seo-768x296.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/organic-clicks-seo-576x222.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/organic-clicks-seo.webp 1197w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>This chart shows the total number of organic clicks over the past 90 days, using data from Google Search Console to track your site&#8217;s search performance and visibility.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>SEO isn’t a “set it and forget it” game. Tracking your progress and adapting your strategy is essential to long-term success.</p>



<p>With comprehensive tools like <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about">Google Search Console</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681?hl=en">Google Analytics 4 (GA4)</a>, and Ahrefs, you can monitor:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Where your traffic is coming from</li>



<li>Which keywords are driving results</li>



<li>What your conversion rates look like</li>



<li>How long visitors are staying on your site</li>
</ul>



<p>If your engagement rates are low, your content might not be resonating. If your rankings are slipping, you might need a content refresh. SEO is about constant refinement &#8211; the brands that adapt the fastest win the game.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Take: To Succeed in 2025, SEO Needs Both Strategy and Adaptability</h2>



<p>SEO isn’t about shortcuts &#8211; it’s about creating valuable content, optimising user experience, and keeping up with Google’s constant changes. By focusing on high-quality content, user intent, and solid technical foundations, you’ll build a future-proof strategy that drives sustainable, long-term growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When it comes to considering the User Experience and User Interface of <a href="/">web design</a>, there are many different areas to consider. From the Usability of the website to the Accessibility to ensure all users can interact and engage with the content. But there is one more obscure area which at first glance can be harder to understand, which is Visual Hierarchy.</p>



<p>Read on to discover what Visual Hierarchy is, its core principles, and why it’s important in Wireframing and Design.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-visual-hierarchy">What is Visual Hierarchy?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, what exactly is Visual Hierarchy? Visual Hierarchy refers to the arrangement of design elements that encourages users to view the most important information first. From main Calls To Action, Featured Services or a company’s USPs (Unique Selling Propositions), Visual Hierarchy is key to ensure users are being made aware of the most essential content first, the next important details second and so on and so forth. Playing a crucial role in all stages of Web Design and Development, Visual Hierarchy guarantees that relevant messages stand out while also retaining an intuitive and interactive User Experience.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Hero is the largest section on the site, and is what users will see the moment they load on the page. There is a large bold headline detailing their ‘Spring Collection 2025’, with a contrasting main Call To Action such as ‘Shop Now’ to encourage users to click further.</li>



<li>The second most prominent section of the site is the Navigation Bar, which has a well spaced out list of pages which is clear to read and click on. This Header nav ensures users can find the right details and products they are looking for with no faff or confusion.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="554" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image1-1024x554.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-9008" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image1-1024x554.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image1-300x162.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image1-768x415.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image1-1536x830.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image1-576x311.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image1-1366x738.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image1.webp 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Notice on the <a href="/portfolio/recharge/">Recharge</a> website, the bold headline, contrasting button, and navigation bar.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Thirdly, below the Hero a section detailing a range of the sites Featured Products, with high-quality imagery, clear product names and a CTA to ‘View More’ of these types of products.</li>



<li>Testimonials would be of lower importance but still relevant to the User Journey. This will be placed lower down the page with smaller text but still simple to view and read on. This section is key for users to feel trust with the company’s past products and is useful one users have become engaged in the type of product they are looking for.</li>



<li>Finally, the Footer of the page is of least importance but still relevant. Offering links to all pages and their categories, with Policies and Legalities in smaller text at the bottom. This information is very much needed, but does not need to compete with content attempting to sell their products to users.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-visual-hierarchy-important">Why Is Visual Hierarchy Important?</h2>



<p>Now we know what Visual Hierarchy means, why is it important? A well informed and organised Visual Hierarchy helps users quickly understand the structure and purpose of the page to discover the most necessary content for them, as the majority of users tend to scan sites, not read word for word.</p>



<p>Websites are more often than not built with key CTAs (Calls To Action) in mind, Visual Hierarchy allows to be directed to said actions. Without the use of Hierarchy, CTAs would blend in too much and would be missed, users would be unsure where to go next, and in turn would cause lower conversion rates due to having no clear direction. This is why on<a href="/ecommerce/"> e-commerce</a> sites for example, products have a bold ‘Add To Cart’ button right below the product, making it the clearest element on the page and high up on the Visual Hierarchy.</p>



<p>It’s not just the readability and organisation of the content that Visual Hierarchy helps with, but the<a href="/branding/"> Branding</a> and Aesthetic of the website as well. A visually engaging website gives a strong sense of credibility and reinforces their brand assets and identity. Having a structured layout with relevant design elements gives users a sense of professionalism and trust with the company, the use of consistent fonts, key branding, spacing and the use of colour theory, creates a powerful and informed brand look and feel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="559" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image2-1024x559.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-9010" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image2-1024x559.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image2-300x164.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image2-768x419.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image2-1536x838.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image2-576x314.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image2-1366x745.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image2.webp 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The <em><a href="/portfolio/nato-innovation-fund/">NATO Innovation Fund&#8217;s</a> website uses consistent fonts, spacing and colour to create an authoritative and informed look and feel.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-principles-of-visual-hierarchy">The Principles Of Visual Hierarchy</h2>



<p>So we have the definition and importance, now for the final piece of the trifecta, the principles.</p>



<p>Visual Hierarchy is created with the uses of many core principles that guide users to engage with a website. These principles allow content and elements to be shown in an interactive and informative way. Below, we’ll explore these key principles and how they help.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sizing">Sizing</h3>



<p>When it comes to design, size really does matter!</p>



<p>Large elements on a website appear more important than others and this is why website designs make use of larger header text compared to body text to ensure the main points stand out.</p>



<p>Proportion is key, if everything&#8217;s the same size, nothing catches the eye. Well considered Visual Hierarchy involves using different sizes of elements to create contrasting sections and allows attention to naturally flow to the main areas of content.</p>



<p>Increasing an element&#8217;s size (in terms of dimension) or its scale ( its size relationship in relation to other elements) is by far one of the easiest ways to emphasize it and draw attention to it.</p>



<p>Similarly the reverse can be applied throughout design. Creating elements that are smaller in size or in comparison to other neighbouring objects can deemphasize them and draw the focal point away from them.</p>



<p>Consider the terms and conditions on an offer or deal &#8211; companies do not necessarily want to draw attention to them, so they design in a small and subtle mannerism.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-colour">Colour</h3>



<p>When we think about the psychology of colour, we typically start to think about blue inciting a sense of calm and red triggering a stress response. In visual hierarchy, we can extrapolate the psychology of colour to further encourage our users to behave in a desired way. For example, we can use colours to sign-post our users to the most valuable or important information on a site. We can use bright colours to attract attention to calls to action, and we can utilise contracting colours for contrasting themes or arguments throughout our content.</p>



<p>Vibrant and well saturated use of colour gains the attention of users, while neutral or toned down colouring blends with the background.</p>



<p>The human attention span has decreased, and as designers, we are in a constant fight with an increasingly fickle attention span to grab the attention and incite action. You can use visual hierarchy to incite action by:</p>



<p>Emphasise that really important information in the same colour throughout your content.</p>



<p>Use contrasting colours for contrasting points or themes throughout content.</p>



<p>Save a colour of your brand’s colour palette (we would recommend the most eye-catching one!) for calls to actions and buttons</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-contrast">Contrast</h3>



<p>So we’ve had a look at why colour is so important, now it’s time to take a look at contrast.</p>



<p>The use of contrast allows specific elements to stand out among the rest, for example a dark button on a lighter toned section will draw users to view it easier, or vice versa.</p>



<p>As your users interact with your website more and more, they will become more and more comfortable and familiar with your brand. Contrary to popular belief, venturing outside of your brand guidelines isn’t always a bad thing. In fact, utilising assets and colours that are contrasting to your brand guidelines is another way to signpost important or essential information to users.</p>



<p>One of the best mediums that uses this strategy is magazines. Every article on the cover of a magazine is just as important as the other, they’re all fighting for your attention. More often than not, you’ll notice that the individual articles on a magazine cover will typically vary in font, size and colouring.</p>



<p>By using varying fonts, colours, sizes and tones throughout your copy and content, you can encourage the user to engage with more of your content than by maintaining a consistent brand style throughout.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="512" height="255" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/vh-magazines.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-9012" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/vh-magazines.webp 512w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/vh-magazines-300x149.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-typography">Typography</h3>



<p>Font sizing is a key principle throughout your Visual Hierarchy considerations, font size and weight automatically determine the order of reading for users. If text is bold or coloured it will naturally be more obvious for users, consider this when trying to reinforce key points in your content, such as the benefits of services a company provides.</p>



<p>Imagine a page where all the text is of the same size and weight. Whilst this would accomplish a sense of equivalency it would also make the page monotonous. There is a high chance you would land on the page, take one look and leave.</p>



<p>The use of different style fonts emphasises the brand identity of a website, serif is a good example of a traditional style, whereas sans-serif could be used for more modern, technology based sites. To avoid an overabundance of types, I recommend no more than 2-3 font types to maintain clear consistency of your branding.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-movement-amp-direction">Movement &amp; Direction</h3>



<p>There are two main patterns eyes will follow when browsing a page, the Z-Pattern or the F-Pattern They work exactly as you may think with users&#8217; eyes following the page in the shape of these letters.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="785" height="349" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/f_reading_pattern_eyetracking_nngroup-cropped.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-9016" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/f_reading_pattern_eyetracking_nngroup-cropped.webp 785w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/f_reading_pattern_eyetracking_nngroup-cropped-300x133.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/f_reading_pattern_eyetracking_nngroup-cropped-768x341.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/f_reading_pattern_eyetracking_nngroup-cropped-576x256.webp 576w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content-discovered/">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The F &#8211; Pattern</h4>



<p>The F was a pattern found to be popularised by NNGroups eye tracking study when studying the eye movements of hundreds of users looking at web pages. The F pattern was found to be applied when reading text heaver pages (Very much like this one)</p>



<p>A reader will scan the page in an F or ‘E’ format: Firstly across the top of the page to read the headlines, and then down the left hand side of the page looking for key headers, numbers or bullet points.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="559" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image3-1024x559.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-9014" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image3-1024x559.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image3-300x164.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image3-768x419.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image3-1536x838.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image3-576x314.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image3-1366x745.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VH-Image3.webp 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Z &#8211; Pattern</h4>



<p>The Z pattern reading focuses on pages or other documents similar to Ads or posters whereby information may not be presented in a block paragraph format. With a Z format pattern the user initially scans horizontally across the page where the important information is likely to be before moving diagonally across to the lower section of the page.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alignment">Alignment</h3>



<p>Whilst it’s important to keep your content digestible, readable and comfortable for a user to engage with, there’s nothing to keep you from being a bit scandalous and breaking the rules of alignment. Standing out from the crowd is no bad thing, especially when it comes to those key pieces of information or data that you want your users to really pay attention to. So what does this look like in practice?</p>



<p>Well, you could&#8230;</p>



<p>Format key information with a central alignment instead of a left handed one.</p>



<p>“Align a quote from the right hand side. Users in the west will typically read from left to right. Aligning occasional pieces of information to the right is a good way to grab attention without making the reader uncomfortable.”<br><em>Chris Baker &#8211; CreativeWeb</em></p>



<p>What’s good for one, may not be good for everyone. So before publishing content, run it past trusted friends and colleagues first. A/B testing doesn’t always have to involve expensive task forces and think tanks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spacing">Spacing</h3>



<p>This principle is very simple to understand, if items or elements are close together they will be seen as related to one another, while more spaced out sections give the impression of them being separate entities.</p>



<p>In<a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles"> Gestalts theory of psychology</a>, the proximity principle applies to grouping objects and elements together to form a perceptual organisation. Whether it&#8217;s minimalist, single page or flat website design, the use of proximity &amp; space is a major factor to consider when separating content, or bringing it together. You might have two calls to action that are related, but are currently so far away from each other that it’s confusing for your users. Are they related? Are they not? Will clicking one do something entirely different to the other?</p>



<p>A simple but very effective example are words. When certain letters are grouped together such as ‘beat’ we see a single word. However, place a space between them ‘be at’ and we have a totally different phrase.</p>



<p>Make sure that your calls to action, buttons, and content are appropriately spaced, located and optimised for a seamless user journey.</p>



<p>The use of white space can also be very effective to reduce overly cluttered sections and enable better readability.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion-what-have-we-learned">Conclusion &#8211; What Have We Learned?</h2>



<p>Well there we have it! A brief summary of the definition of Visual Hierarchy, its importance and principles, so what have we learnt?</p>



<p>We’ve learnt that the foundation of effective website design is the use of Visual Hierarchy, it shapes how users engage and are informed by the content they perceive, as well as how organising elements based on importance can create exciting and user-friendly experiences.</p>



<p>A well-informed Visual Hierarchy improves usability in its own right, guaranteeing users can easily gain access to the right information for them to make informed decisions and to take key actions from product purchases to exploring more. With no clear Visual Hierarchy, websites become bland, hard to navigate and confusing to users, leading them to click away and end their User Journey before it even begins.</p>



<p>By making use of Visual Hierarchy’s key principles, the design of a website guides users attention in a free–flowing and natural way, letting them take the reins on their own exploration of an aesthetically pleasing and highly-functional site.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, web design isn’t just about the creative aspects, it’s also about communication. Understanding Visual Hierarchy throughout all phases of web design ensures the right information and takeaways reaches the demographic in the most effective and insightful way, making the experience impactful, informative and enjoyable.</p>

<p>As a leading <a href="/">web design agency</a> based in , we use our skills to give back to people through meaningful and purposeful work whenever we can. We recently worked pro bono to develop a website with The Great Friendship Project, who are a non-profit organisation, dedicated to creating spaces where young people can build real friendships and feel supported, that reflects the impactful and inspiring work of this growing charity.</p>

<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-our-commitment-to-csr-and-pro-bono-work">Our Commitment to CSR and Pro Bono Work</h2>



<p>The Great Friendship Project was entirely pro bono as part of our corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative, where we focus on supporting charities and non-profits. We achieve this by working together and providing them with high quality website design and development to help highlight their cause and achieve even greater things. As an agency that truly cares, we are very passionate about using our skills and expertise to help organisations like this who are working to make a real difference in the lives of others.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-about-the-great-friendship-project">About The Great Friendship Project</h2>



<p>Loneliness among young people is on the rise and The Great Friendship Project is helping to change this through building connection and community. Founded in 2021, they are a non-profit organisation dedicated to building spaces where young people can create real friendships and feel supported through holding community events, educational workshops and outreach programs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They approached us in 2024, with a need for a complete overhaul of their online presence to help promote their community, connection and friendship initiative as well as to spread their message.</p>

<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-collaboration">The Collaboration</h2>



<p>To bring the vision to life, we partnered with JKR Global, a creative agency that helped refresh the <a href="/branding/">branding</a>, visual identity and UI/UX design of The Great Friendship Project. Our role was to take JKR’s creative vision into an interactive and engaging site using some magic front end development, all whilst highlighting the great things this project does from their community activities, support resources, awareness campaigns and research to drive change.</p>



<p>Together with JKR and the team at The Great Friendship Project, we created a fun, warm and engaging website that captures the community spirit and authenticity of the charity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="573" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/FP_research-1024x573.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-9021" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/FP_research-1024x573.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/03/FP_research-300x168.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/03/FP_research-768x430.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/03/FP_research-1536x860.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/03/FP_research-576x322.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/03/FP_research-1366x765.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/03/FP_research-1600x896.webp 1600w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/03/FP_research.webp 1722w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-result">The Result</h2>



<p>The new website is interactive and accessible, becoming the perfect tool for The Great Friendship Project to use to promote and support their mission, have greater reach and visibility as well as to continue making an impact. It acts as a central hub where visitors and the community can discover this charity’s ethos, view real data showcasing the results of their work, discover upcoming events, read community members first hand experiences and learn about their growing network of brand partnerships.</p>



<p>We are incredibly proud to have collaborated with such an amazing charity, where we achieved not only a beautiful website design but one that provides a digital home for those that want to be a part of this impactful cause and community, resulting in something very special.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are a local charity or a non-profit looking for digital support, <a href="/contact-us/">get in touch</a> as we are always looking for ways to support causes through our pro bono initiatives.</p>

<p>Our new website is finally here! After months of work,&nbsp;we’re excited to reveal the brand new <a href="/"><strong>CreativeWeb</strong> website</a>!&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s complete with a fresh new look, an evolved &amp; improved brand identity, as well as a showcase of our latest, award-winning projects.</p>



<p>Like many agencies, our own site took a backseat while we focused on developing cutting-edge websites for our clients. But this update was long overdue! It&#8217;s more than just a redesign, it marks a brand evolution, a refined identity that better reflects who we are today and where we’re headed next.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-planning-your-website-project-where-to-start">Planning Your Website Project: Where to Start?</h2>



<p>Launching a new website (or giving an old one a much-needed refresh) is a big decision for any business. Whether you’re a start-up or an established brand, careful planning and taking the time to think things through ensures you get the most out of your investment. Without a clear plan, you&#8217;ll risk blown budgets, missed deadlines, and disappointment with a website that doesn’t actually do what you need it to.</p>



<p>So, here&#8217;s a guide website planning guide direct from a <a href="/">web design agency</a> to make sure that the above doesn&#8217;t happen.</p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer is-style-small"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Choose-the-Right-Name-Domain-1-1024x683.png" style="border-radius: 1rem;" alt="Choose the Right Name &amp; Domain" class="wp-image-9847" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Choose-the-Right-Name-Domain-1-1024x683.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Choose-the-Right-Name-Domain-1-300x200.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Choose-the-Right-Name-Domain-1-768x512.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Choose-the-Right-Name-Domain-1-576x384.png 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Choose-the-Right-Name-Domain-1-1366x911.png 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Choose-the-Right-Name-Domain-1.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer is-style-small"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-choose-the-right-name-amp-domain">Choose the Right Name &amp; Domain</h3>



<p>If you’re starting fresh with a new brand or website, picking the right name is a critical first step. Here’s how to avoid naming disasters:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Google It:</strong> Before you get too attached to a name, please Google it. You want to see what already exists under your potential name. If there’s an established business dominating search results, you will most likely struggle to rank, and rebranding later will only be a headache for you later down the line.</li>



<li><strong>Check Domain Availability: </strong>Your domain name should match your brand name as closely as possible. Don&#8217;t include any awkward dashes or weird spellings that people won’t remember. Check if your preferred domain is available using a domain registrar. If it’s already taken or only available for at a crazy high price, it’s worth considering alternatives. Also consider the domain extension. If you&#8217;re a SA-based business, a .co.SA can give you a slight SEO advantage and shows you&#8217;re targeting the SA market. If you&#8217;re planning to go international, a .com or another recognised top-level domain may be more appropriate. It&#8217;s best to steer clear of the newer or more unusual extensions, as they can sometimes cause issues with email deliverability and don’t always look trustworthy.</li>



<li><strong>Company Name Registration:</strong> Are you planning to register as a limited company? Check availability on <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.SA/">Companies House</a> (if you’re in the SA) to ensure your name is unique and legally available.</li>



<li><strong>Trademark Check:</strong> You can to avoid legal drama down the line. If your name is a core part of your brand, make sure it’s not already trademarked in your industry. Again, saving yourself yet another headache later on.</li>
</ul>



<p>This might seem basic, but it&#8217;s crucial – don’t start building a brand or website until you&#8217;ve done proper checks. Make sure the name isn’t already trademarked and the domain is available. I’ve worked on projects where everything was finished and we had to rebrand two or three times because this step was skipped. Do the due diligence early. It saves a lot of time, money and hassle down the line.</p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer is-style-small"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1536" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Define-Your-Website-Goals-Features-1.png" style="border-radius: 1rem;" alt="Define Your Website Goals &amp; Features" class="wp-image-9828" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Define-Your-Website-Goals-Features-1.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Define-Your-Website-Goals-Features-1-300x200.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Define-Your-Website-Goals-Features-1-1024x683.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Define-Your-Website-Goals-Features-1-768x512.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Define-Your-Website-Goals-Features-1-576x384.png 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Define-Your-Website-Goals-Features-1-1366x911.png 1366w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /></figure>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer is-style-small"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-define-your-website-goals-amp-features">Define Your Website Goals &amp; Features</h3>



<p>Before jumping straight into the design, be crystal clear on what your website needs to achieve.</p>



<p>Ask yourself:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>What’s the main goal, and what do you want people to do?</strong> (Is it lead generation, eCommerce, portfolio, brand awareness?) Once that’s clear, think about the key action you want people to take. That might be filling in a contact form, making a purchase, signing up to something, or booking a call. If you’ve got more than one goal, that’s fine too. Just be clear on what matters most.</li>



<li><strong>What action do you want visitors to take?</strong> (is it to buy, book, subscribe, get in touch?) That’s your primary call to action. For an eCommerce site, that might be making a purchase. A secondary goal could be signing up for your newsletter. For B2B, it’s usually lead generation, filling out a contact form or booking a call.</li>



<li><strong>Who’s your audience?</strong> (And how do they browse online?) Think about who’s landing on the site. You might have more than one type of visitor. For example, customers and investors will care about different things and take different routes through the site. Customers might be looking for services and pricing. Investors might want to read about the company, the team, and your wider impact.</li>



<li><strong>What features does the site need?</strong> (is it contact forms, booking systems, membership areas, blogs?) List the essentials. That could be contact forms, booking systems, a blog, payment tools, gated content, or anything else that supports the goal. This all forms part of your scope and helps you get a realistic idea of time and cost.</li>
</ul>



<p>Top Tip: If your project is complex, write a website brief. The clearer you are, the better your cost estimates and timelines will be.</p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer is-style-small"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Timeline-and-Project-Milestones-1-1024x683.png" style="border-radius: 1rem;" alt="Timeline and Project Milestones" class="wp-image-9826" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Timeline-and-Project-Milestones-1-1024x683.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Timeline-and-Project-Milestones-1-300x200.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Timeline-and-Project-Milestones-1-768x512.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Timeline-and-Project-Milestones-1-576x384.png 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Timeline-and-Project-Milestones-1-1366x911.png 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Timeline-and-Project-Milestones-1.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer is-style-small"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-timeline-and-project-milestones">Timeline and Project Milestones</h3>



<p>When you&#8217;re planning a website, it’s important to map out the phases of the project from the outset. One of the first things we’ll usually ask is <em>when you want the site launched</em>? Then we’ll plan backwards from there, mapping out the project approach based on the time available, if its a shorter timeline we might run the project agile like a sprint . The timeline should be realistic, with buffer time included (especially during the design phase, which is often the hardest to estimate for). Setting clear milestones also helps everyone stay on the same page and track progress properly.</p>



<p>We typically break projects into four main phases:</p>



<p><strong>Discovery</strong>  &#8211; This is essentially the planning stage. It’s where you pull everything together, from your goals and target audience to site structure and features.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Creation of a discovery document</li>



<li>Wireframing to define layout and user journey</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Design</strong> &#8211; Once we’ve nailed the structure, we move on to visuals. This covers everything from initial concepts to a full set of page designs.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Homepage design concept</li>



<li>Full subpage design rollout</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Development</strong> &#8211; With the designs signed off, we move into build. This covers both how the site looks and how it works behind the scenes.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Front-end development based on approved designs</li>



<li>Back-end development, CMS setup, and any integrations</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Testing &amp; Launch</strong> &#8211; Before anything goes live, everything’s checked and double-checked. We test across devices, fix any issues, and then launch when ready.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Interoperability and Q&amp;A testing</li>



<li>Final fixes and go-live</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer is-style-small"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-content-planning">Content Planning </h3>



<p>Content is often an afterthought, but without it, your site is just a pretty shell. Writing web copy takes a lot longer than you think, so start early. A typical website has around 400 &#8211; 600 words per page, which all quickly adds up.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Who’s writing the content?</strong> If you’re handling it in-house, get started as soon as possible. If you need help, consider professional copywriting services to ensure high-quality, SEO-optimised content that converts.</li>



<li><strong>Gather images &amp; media:</strong> Will you need custom photography, stock images, or video content? Finding visuals at the last minute will only equal to stress. So just plan ahead.</li>



<li><strong>SEO Considerations:</strong> Content isn’t just about sounding good. It needs to rank. Optimised headings, keywords, and metadata are key for getting found on Google.</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer is-style-small"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SEO-1-1024x683.png" style="border-radius: 1rem;" alt="SEO" class="wp-image-9829" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SEO-1-1024x683.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SEO-1-300x200.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SEO-1-768x512.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SEO-1-576x384.png 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SEO-1-1366x911.png 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SEO-1.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer is-style-small"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-seo">SEO</h3>



<p>A lot of people group SEO in with content strategy, but it deserves its own focus. This is especially true if you&#8217;re redesigning an existing website. If you are not planning for your site to rank, how is anyone going to find it?</p>



<p>Start by reviewing how your current site performs. Use tools like Google Analytics and Search Console to understand what pages are ranking, what they are ranking for, and whether that is actually helping your business. Look at bounce rate, engagement, and user behaviour. Gather that data and bring it into your website plan.</p>



<p>We usually handle this during the discovery phase, but it is something worth doing upfront. Go to your agency or team and say, here is what is ranking, here is what we want to rank for, and here is where we are trying to get to. It helps shape the strategy and informs better decisions.</p>



<p>You should also look at your competitors. What are they ranking for, what keywords are they targeting, and where can you do better? This insight feeds directly into how you structure your site, plan your content, and improve visibility.</p>



<p>The long and short of it is this. SEO is not something to leave until after launch. It should be baked into the planning from the beginning.</p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer is-style-small"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-branding-amp-design">Branding &amp; Design</h3>



<p>Your website is like your digital shop window. It should instantly communicate who you are and why you’re different. If you already have an established brand identity, make sure that your website aligns with it. If not, this may be the time to think about a branding refresh. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Logo &amp; Colour Palette:</strong> Stick to consistent brand colours, typography, and logos for a polished, professional look.</li>



<li><strong>User Experience (UX) Design:</strong> Navigation should be intuitive and seamless, if users can’t find what they need in a few clicks, they’ll leave faster than you can say “bounce rate.”</li>



<li><strong>Mobile First:</strong> With 70%+ of traffic coming from mobile, prioritising mobile-friendly design is no longer optional.</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer is-style-small"></div>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-budgeting-amp-choosing-the-right-web-agency">Budgeting &amp; Choosing the Right Web Agency</h3>



<p>A website isn’t just another business expense, it’s a serious investment in your brand’s growth and online success. But how much should you budget? The answer depends on what you need your website to do.</p>



<p>Here’s some key factors that impact your website’s cost:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Design Complexity:</strong> A fully custom-built site will naturally cost more than an off-the-shelf template, but it also gives you complete creative freedom.</li>



<li><strong>Number of pages:</strong> A simple five-page brochure site is relatively quick and easy. A multi-layered website with tons of content, now that’s a bigger project.</li>



<li><strong>Functionality &amp; Features:</strong> if you need an eCommerce store, membership system, booking tool, or integrations, this means more functionality which means more development time.</li>



<li><strong>Content Creation:</strong> Great design needs great content. If you’re writing it yourself, factor in the time. If you’re hiring professionals, factor in the cost.</li>



<li><strong>SEO &amp; Performance:</strong> Want your site to rank on Google and load at lightning speed? You need a proper SEO setup and performance optimisations are key.</li>
</ul>



<p>Are you unsure how much to budget for your website? Use our <a href="/web-design-cost-estimator/">Website Cost Estimator</a> to get a breakdown tailored to your project.</p>



<p>Top Tip: Don’t just go for the cheapest option. A low price website might cost less upfront, but if it doesn’t perform well, you’ll be paying more to fix it later. Look for experience, client reviews, and a portfolio that shows an agency understands your vision.</p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer is-style-small"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-technical-considerations-amp-hosting">Technical Considerations &amp; Hosting</h3>



<p>A beautifully designed website is useless if it’s slow, insecure, or constantly crashing! Speed, security, and performance aren’t just afterthoughts, they’re the backbone of a successful site. No one stays for a slow-loading page, and Google definitely will not rank one highly. Here&#8217;s what to condiser:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Hosting &amp; Security:</strong> Invest in a fast, reliable hosting provider with SSL security, regular backups, and malware protection.</li>



<li><strong>Speed &amp; Performance:</strong> A slow website kills conversions. Make sure your site is optimised with caching, a CDN (Content Delivery Network), and image compression.</li>



<li><strong>Analytics Setup:</strong> Install Google Analytics &amp; Search Console from the start to track performance and user behaviour.&nbsp;</li>



<li></li>
</ul>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer is-style-small"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-thoughts-plan-now-succeed-later">Final Thoughts: Plan Now, Succeed Later</h2>



<p>Planning your website properly before diving in saves a lot of hassle later on. It helps avoid common pitfalls, keeps costs down, speeds things up, and generally leads to a much better result. It also helps you figure out what the best route is for your business – because let’s face it, there are a lot of different options out there nowadays.</p>



<p>So take your time. Sit back, think it through, and map it all out. You’ll be glad you did once things get moving.</p>



<p>And if you’re not quite sure where to start, or you want someone to steer you in the right direction, feel free to get in touch. That’s often what you’re paying an agency for – not just to build the thing, but to help you make the right calls from the start.</p>

<p>Let’s Talk About Your Project!</p>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer is-style-small"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faq-s">FAQ&#8217;s</h2>



<p><strong><strong>Can I create a website by myself?</strong></strong><br>Yes, you can. There are website builders like Wix, Squarespace and more recently AI platforms like Lovable which make it very easy to get something up-and-running with no technical know-how. You choose a template, add your own content, and off you go.</p>



<p><br>But if your site&#8217;s a major player in lead generation or traffic conversion, then it&#8217;s worth taking a moment to see how solid the foundations are. A templated site can get things off the ground, but where it&#8217;s not especially well thought through, then you end up with a lower conversion rate. Consider, say, a generic sort of template converting 1% and a thoroughly-thought-out-site converting 5%. That difference can dramatically affect your return on marketing dollars. A bad-performing site doesn&#8217;t just disappoint expectations, it&#8217;s an expense.</p>



<p><br>There&#8217;s also the bigger picture. Current marketing is trending even more toward brand impressions and recognition, and an off-the-shelf website isn&#8217;t going to be likely to leave a lasting impression. So by all means, go ahead and build it yourself, just be mindful of what it needs to do within your company long-term.</p>



<p><strong>How much does it cost to start a website?</strong></p>



<p>You could, technically, get a website live with no expenses, or something in the region of £10–£20 per month should you be taking bare-bones hosting. Or, going to the extreme opposite, a bespoke-built, interactive, enterprise-grade website could be into tens of thousands. It all depends upon ambition.</p>



<p><br>If you want something simple and templated, with no real bells and whistles, it&#8217;s going to be very cheap. But if your website&#8217;s a central part of your business and you want it to look sharp, convert well, and accurately represent your brand, that takes thought, time and money.</p>



<p><br>The better question here is &#8211; <em>what is your website worth to you?</em></p>



<p><strong>What are the 7 major steps to designing a webpage?</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Discovery – This is where everything gets assembled. Goals, audience, research into your competition, references, all of it. Keep it all together so you’re not guessing later.</li>



<li>Planning – This is where everything gets planned correctly. Sitemap, wireframes, structure of content. You want to be planning your content here as well, and not leaving it as something to be completed later.</li>



<li>Design – If you are new to having a brand, then you’ll first have to get that sorted out. Having that taken care of, start with the homepage and then go ahead and work with subpages with a similar design language.</li>



<li>Front-end development – This is coding up the design so it&#8217;s usable in-browser. The things everyone actually looks at and interacts with.</li>



<li>Back-end development – Anything more complex falls here. That could be CMS integration, dynamic behavior, anything server-side.</li>



<li>Interoperability and QA testing – The proper cross-browser and device testing, to check if it&#8217;s functional, accessible, all that. This needs to be done pre-launch.</li>



<li>Launch, maintenance and marketing – Getting it live is just step one. You’ll then be liable to keep it up to date, secure, and to get traffic to it.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Is wireframing necessary?</strong><br>Yes, it is. It forces you to step back and think about user flow. It helps you to sketch out how your users are going to flow through the website, what you’re actually presenting them with, and where. The look comes next. If you’re trying to do them side by side, it becomes extremely easy to prioritize appearances over usability. That’s where things get problematic. Skipping wireframes generally leads to bad UX and lower engagement. And lots of straightforward website builders don’t allow easy proper planning, which is one reason. If you want your site to do well, wireframing&#8217;s not something to be avoided.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Imagine you&#8217;re trying to remember a song lyric, a song you&#8217;ve not heard in a while. The first time you might struggle a little, but the second time, your brain will remember it instantly. That is how caching sort of works. Your website stores information so it doesn’t have to reload it every single time from scratch, making it faster and more efficient.</p>



<p>Caching (which is pronounced “cach-ing”) is a very important web development technique that improves not only improves site speed, but also reduces server load, and enhances user experience. In 2025, with Goggle’s Core Web Vitals shaping SEO rankings and users expecting instant page loads, caching is now essential. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-different-types-of-caching">Different Types of Caching</h2>



<p>{Info graphic here of different types of caching types}</p>



<p>Different caching methods target different parts of your site’s performance. Here are the different types of caching methods:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-browser-caching">1. Browser Caching</h3>



<p>Browser caching stores static assets (like image, JavaScript, and CSS files) directly on a user’s device. Instead of downloading these files again and again each time they visit, their browser retrieves them from local storage, making pages load much faster.</p>



<p>Benefits of Browser Caching:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Faster page loads:</strong> Users don’t have to wait for repeat downloads.</li>



<li><strong>Lower server load:</strong> Fewer requests sent to the web server means better performance.</li>



<li><strong>Better user experience:</strong> A faster site keeps visitors engaged.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you update a website image or style, users might still see the old version, which is why cache expiration settings are really important to manage.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-page-caching">2. Page Caching</h3>



<p>Page caching saves a ready-made version of the page, so it loads instantly instead of being generated from scratch with every single visit.</p>



<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Normally, when a visitor lands on a page, the server processes multiple database queries before displaying the page.</li>



<li>With page caching, the server saves a ready-to-go version of the page and delivers it instantly to visitors.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>When to Use Page Caching:</strong></p>



<p>Page caching is great for blogs, landing pages, and informational pages. But it&#8217;s not so great for dynamic sites like live chat platforms or personalised dashboards, where content changes frequently.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-server-side-caching">3. Server-Side Caching</h3>



<p>This method stores data on the hosting server itself, which reduces workload and improves performance. In 2025, <a href="https://medium.com/towards-data-science/maximizing-ai-efficiency-in-production-with-caching-a-cost-efficient-performance-booster-9b8afd200efd">AI-driven caching techniques</a> have made this process even more efficient by predicting and preloading content before users even request it! </p>



<p><strong>Common Types of Server-Site Caching:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Object Caching:</strong> This stores repeated database queries for faster access.</li>



<li><strong>Opcode Caching:</strong> This saves compiled PHP scripts, so they don’t need to be processed repeatedly.</li>



<li><strong>Edge Caching:</strong> This uses a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to cache content closer to the user for global performance boosts.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-content-delivery-network-cdn-caching">4. Content Delivery Network (CDN) Caching</h3>



<p>{CDN world map showing how CDNs distribute content globally graphic}</p>



<p>A CDN caches website content across multiple global servers, helping users access pages faster no matter where they are in the world. But why do CDNs matter?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Improve Load Times</strong> by serving content from the nearest server.</li>



<li><strong>Reduce Bandwidth Usage </strong>and offloads traffic from your hosting provider.</li>



<li><strong>Boost Reliability</strong> by preventing server overloads and downtime.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-key-benefits-of-caching">The Key Benefits of Caching</h2>



<p>Caching holds many benefits, some of which include:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Faster Load Times &amp; Smoother Experience:</strong> Caching reduces network traffic and improves load times, which directly boosts site engagement and conversions.</li>



<li><strong>Lower Costs:</strong> Reducing server requests means lower bandwidth costs, which is especially helpful for high-traffic sites.</li>



<li><strong>Content Availability (Even If Servers Go Down):</strong> In cases of short-term network issues or server failures, cached content keeps your site accessible, even when your server has a few hiccups.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-downside-of-caching">The Downside of Caching</h2>



<p>Caching is great, until it <em>isn’t</em>. The most common issue is seeing outdated content.</p>



<p>For example, if you change an image on your homepage but you can still see the old one, your browser may have cached the previous version. This is especially frustrating during website development, where clients might see outdated pages instead of the latest updates.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-solution">The Solution</h2>



<p>If you’re experiencing issues with your content, the solution is to clear your cache!</p>



<p> Here’s how to do it:</p>



<p><strong>Clearing Browser Cache (Google Chrome Example)</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Click the <strong>three-dot menu</strong> in the top right corner</li>



<li>Select More tools <strong>&gt; Clear browsing data</strong></li>



<li>Choose<strong> Cached images and files,</strong> then click<strong> Clear data.</strong></li>
</ol>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdI7rkhjajQ8FD-X0p4_oobIrSn4lPWqB2t4nGLhIZ5Q-JB1m0CWtXOTFFg1JS8LTmPgCKMiK2nni0nlAff7dhYelPvZU2I_O2UYCk2aHZ_dERr3syjSrt6IXxIjOTmmEDuuC8x?key=T-7GGRTXlN22Kn5-ykwYwgYP" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong>Clearing Cache in WordPress (If Using a Caching Plugin)</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Log into your <strong>WordPress dashboard.</strong></li>



<li>Navigate to your caching plugin settings (e.g <strong>WP Rocket, LiteSpeed Cache, or Cloudflare APO</strong>).</li>



<li>Click <strong>Clear Cache</strong> or <strong>Purge All Caches</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p></p>



<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfcFtuFibGPtUiS7nP21iRRaE0rQzzQtFqs_uYZgcycFm7HFEbspmcROW3O0Wh20A49e3kvE4y3CoVLWtgGbxyy3DpArc5PaeIAmtHDhsnADRMs6k27ucQhf61OWV-WhSsXtlwqMA?key=T-7GGRTXlN22Kn5-ykwYwgYP" width="576" height="177"></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-role-of-caching-in-seo-amp-core-web-vitals">The Role of Caching in SEO &amp; Core Web Vitals</h2>



<p>Google’s Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, and CLS) prioritise page speed and user experience for ranking. A well-cached website improves:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): </strong>Which means faster pages will rank higher.</li>



<li><strong>FID (First Input Delay):</strong> Helps lower server load, which equals better interactivity.</li>



<li><strong>CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):</strong> Cached layouts keep pages from jumping around while loading.</li>
</ol>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-is-caching-essential-in-2025">So Is Caching Essential in 2025?</h2>



<p>Absolutely! Whether it’s browser caching, page caching, server-side caching, or CDNs, caching is non-negotiable for a fast, high-performing website. It’s all about balance, your site should be lightning fast without showing any outdated content. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Sustainability is something that affects us all, and has evolved into a crucial factor across all industries - it was only a matter of time before Web Design would become one of them.</p>
<p>The post <a href="/website-design/sustainable-website-design-tips/">Sustainable Website Design: How to Reduce Your Digital Carbon Footprint</a> appeared first on <a href="">CreativeWeb</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Why Sustainable Web Design Matters</h2>
<p>Sustainability isn&#8217;t just about getting rid of plastic straws or recycling your coffee cup, it also includes the digital world too. The internet might feel as though it&#8217;s not really there, but it accounts for around 4% of global carbon emissions, and that number keeps growing as our online activity skyrockets!</p>
<p>At CreativeWeb, we&#8217;ve worked on projects where sustainability was a key focus, like our work for the COP26 Climate Conference: Net Zero Needs Nuclear. More businesses are prioritising eco-friendly websites, and we see this shift becoming the new standard in web design for the years to come.</p>
<p>So, how do we design websites that do not cost the Earth? Let&#8217;s break it down.</p>
<hr />
<h3>What Is Sustainable Website Design?</h3>
<p>A sustainable website minimises its environmental impact by reducing energy consumption, promoting accessibility, and following ethical digital practices. The modern web comes with many challenges such as: the rise of data-heavy sites, growing energy consumption, and, on the darker side, questionable tech practices that compromise user privacy, promote misinformation, or manipulate user behaviour.</p>
<p>A truly sustainable website should be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy-efficient:</strong> Uses fewer resources, meaning less energy consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Green-powered:</strong> Hosted on servers running renewable energy.</li>
<li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> Optimised for performance with lower data usage.</li>
<li><strong>Puts users first:</strong> Accessibility-focused and user-friendly.</li>
<li><strong>Ethically responsible:</strong> Free from deceptive design tactics, privacy violations, or manipulative tech practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sustainable web design doesn&#8217;t just help the planet, it also improves site speed, SEO rankings, and overall user experience. So really it&#8217;s a win-win.</p>
<hr />
<h3>How Green Is Your Website?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Before making improvements, it helps to see where you already stand. The <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">Website Carbon Calculator</a> is a handy little tool that estimates your site&#8217;s carbon emissions and compares it to the internet average.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Guess what? Even brands that are publicly all about sustainability often unfortunately are not. Take Greenpeace SA&#8217;s website back in 2022, which produced 1.51g of CO2 per visit! That&#8217;s equal to around nine trees&#8217; worth of carbon absorption per year. Multiply that by thousands (or millions) of visits, and the environmental impact becomes <em>massive</em>. Let that just sink in&#8230; </p>
<p class="mb-4">Fast forward to today, and while many websites have switched to greener energy sources, some major companies are still lagging behind. Platforms like Pinterest, Yahoo, Samsung, Twitter/X and many more continue to rely on unsustainable hosting, demonstrating that there&#8217;s still work to be done. (Read more on this <a href="https://www.klatch.co.SA/blog/top-50-websites-worldwide-carbon-emissions">here</a>)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="mb-4 alignnone" src="/img/posts/website-carbon-calc.jpg" alt="The Website Carbon Calculator" width="1300" height="851" /></p>
<p class="mb-4">So, what actually affects a website&#8217;s carbon footprint?</p>
<hr />
<h3>What Makes a Website More (or Less) Sustainable?</h3>
<p>When calculating a website’s carbon impact, tools such as the Carbon Calculator look at many factors. While they might vary depending on the provider, these are the key metrics they are looking for:</p>
<h4>1. Data Transfer &amp; Hosting Energy Use</h4>
<p data-start="164" data-end="477">Every time someone loads a website, data is transferred between their device and the hosting server. The bigger the page, the more energy is required to load it. This might not seem like a big deal on its own, but multiply that by thousands (or even millions) of visits, and the environmental impact quickly adds up.</p>
<h4 data-start="479" data-end="528"><strong data-start="484" data-end="528">2. How Data Size Affects Energy Consumption</strong></h4>
<ul data-start="529" data-end="1009">
<li data-start="529" data-end="685">Websites that are bloated with oversized images, auto play videos, and excessive scripts require more energy to load, which increases carbon emissions.</li>
<li data-start="686" data-end="865">Returning visitors consume less energy than first-time users because cached elements (like images and stylesheets) are stored on their device instead of being re-downloaded.</li>
<li data-start="866" data-end="1009">A well-optimised website keeps individual page sizes below a few megabytes, reducing strain on servers and improving the user experience.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. What&#8217;s the Cost of Web Data Energy Use?</h4>
<p>This metric is essentially how much energy is needed for users to load your website. Calculators will look for an average energy cost related to the geographic location your website is being served from, whilst factoring in the power required for your servers, as well as the power required of the user to view the site &#8211; ie. their device, home router and network. In the SA, the estimated data energy cost is around 1.8Wh/GB, and is a key part of what makes up your overall Carbon Impact score.</p>
<h4>4. Why Does Green vs Traditional Hosting Matter?</h4>
<p>Your choice of web hosting plays a major role in your site’s carbon footprint. <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/">The Green Web Foundation</a> tracks hosting providers globally, highlighting which ones use renewable energy and which ones still rely on fossil fuels. Here&#8217;s a major difference between green and traditional hosting:</p>
<ul data-start="1630" data-end="1917">
<li data-start="1630" data-end="1770"><strong data-start="1632" data-end="1660">Traditional data centres</strong> contribute heavily to carbon emissions, with standard grid electricity producing around <strong data-start="1749" data-end="1769">475g CO₂ per kWh</strong>.</li>
<li data-start="1771" data-end="1917"><strong data-start="1773" data-end="1802">Renewable-powered hosting</strong>, on the other hand, significantly reduces impact with wind energy, for example, which emits as little as <strong data-start="1897" data-end="1916">11g CO₂ per kWh</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="1919" data-end="2083">If sustainability is a priority, switching to a hosting provider that runs on renewables is one of the most effective ways to cut your digital carbon footprint.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="mb-4 alignnone" src="/img/posts/green-web-check.jpg" alt="The Green Web" width="802" height="463" /></p>
<h4>5. How Website Traffic Impacts Carbon Emissions</h4>
<p data-start="2139" data-end="2369">The more visitors your site gets, the greater the energy demand, but that doesn’t mean you should shy away from growing your audience. Instead, optimising caching, compression, and efficient code can help manage the impact.</p>
<ul data-start="2371" data-end="2636">
<li data-start="2371" data-end="2490">Websites with high returning visitor rates benefit from cached content, which reduces unnecessary data transfers.</li>
<li data-start="2491" data-end="2636">On average, 30% of web traffic comes from returning users, meaning a well-cached site can significantly cut down on repeated data requests.</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="2638" data-end="2879" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">By being mindful of how data is handled, optimising page sizes, and choosing an eco-friendly host, businesses can make a big difference in reducing their website’s carbon footprint while maintaining fast, high-performing digital experiences.</p>
<hr />
<h3>How to Make Your Website More Sustainable</h3>
<p>If your website isn’t as green as you’d like, here are some easy ways to make it better for the environment and your visitors:</p>
<h4>1. Limit Video Content</h4>
<p data-start="492" data-end="665">Videos are one of the most energy-consuming elements on a website. They require large amounts of data to stream, increasing both server load and carbon emissions.</p>
<ul data-start="667" data-end="997">
<li data-start="667" data-end="758">If video isn’t essential, consider removing it or replacing it with static imagery.</li>
<li data-start="759" data-end="881">If you do use video, disable autoplay—this prevents unnecessary streaming when users don’t actually want to watch.</li>
<li data-start="882" data-end="997">Host videos externally (like YouTube or Vimeo) rather than embedding them directly to reduce server strain.</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="999" data-end="1278">As of 2025, the environmental impact of streaming video has grown even bigger than most people realise. <a href="https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2025/01/23/video-streaming-emissions-double-that-of-aviation-industry/">Recent research shows</a> that the TV and videos streaming industry now accounts for 4% of global carbon emissions &#8211; double that of the aviation industry&#8217;s 2% share. While streaming platforms have been working to improve energy efficiency, high-definition and ultra-high-definition video still require a huge amount of power.</p>
<h4>2. Optimise &amp; Compress Images</h4>
<p>Essentially, use fewer images &#8211; and the images you do use should be optimised, smaller and ‘lazy-load’ into the page when required.</p>
<p>If you’re running a WordPress site, there are dozens of well-supported image compression plugins that can help to reduce your page weight. On many of our client sites, we use plugins such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ewww-image-optimizer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EWWW Image Optimiser</a> to help achieve the best sizes possible.</p>
<p>In addition to images, custom fonts can also require a chunk of data to load, using native system fonts, or reducing the number of font weights required by your site is another easy way to reduce load size and improve your carbon score.</p>
<h4>3. Switch to renewables</h4>
<p>Your energy sources matter. A lot of energy is required to actually show websites to the user, for instance to power servers &amp; data centres 24/7, keep them cool, make them secure and optimise their routing to be fast. Such a great amount of energy usage has a negative impact on the environment, so choosing a green web hosting solution can be a big step towards becoming more eco-friendly. Look for a provider or data centre that sources most of its electricity from renewable energy. Centres located in The Netherlands are some of the leading hosting platforms in this regard.</p>
<h4>4. Clean &amp; Minify Your Code</h4>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p data-start="0" data-end="434">In 2025, the push for greener websites has never been more urgent. With digital consumption at an all-time high, making web design more sustainable can have a real impact in the fight against climate change. Every website, large or small, contributes to the internet’s carbon footprint and right now, only 5% of websites are powered by renewable energy, while the internet remains one of the world’s biggest polluters.</p>
<p data-start="436" data-end="951">Instead of overloading websites with unnecessary animations, oversized media, and bloated code simply because we can, it&#8217;s time to design with intention. Every piece of content, every data transfer, and every hosting decision should serve a purpose, without unnecessary waste. Choosing eco-friendly hosting, optimising performance, and reducing data-heavy elements aren’t just sustainability wins, they create faster, more efficient websites that improve user experience and boost conversions.</p>
<p data-start="953" data-end="1271">If you’re looking to reduce your website’s carbon footprint and build a future-proof, energy-efficient digital presence, we can help. At CreativeWeb, we’ve worked on projects that prioritise sustainability, helping brands make a tangible impact while maintaining high-performance web experiences.</p>

<p>When NATO Innovation Fund (NIF), a standalone venture capital fund, backed by 24 NATO Allies, approached Solid.5 for their website redesign, they didn’t want just any new look, they needed something bold, cutting-edge and high-performance. They needed a website that would reflect their role as a €1 billion deep-tech venture capital fund. <em>Challenge accepted</em>.</p>



<p>The result? An <strong>award-winning website</strong>, earning top industry recognition, including Gold at the  Design Awards!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyond-the-basics-a-website-built-to-lead">Beyond the Basics: A Website Built to Lead</h2>



<p>Previously, NIF’s website had all the appeal of a government brochure, functional but uninspiring. As a venture capital fund, supporting cutting-edge, deep-tech startups, their online presence needed to reflect that ambition and forward-thinking mindset.</p>



<p>Our job was clear: modernise their digital identity. A redesign that would not only enhance user experience but also its interactivity and scalability; All whilst aligning with their goal of driving innovation in technology and global investment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new site had to:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Engage a diverse audience, from investors to startup founders.</li>



<li>Maintain a professional, authoritative presence (but with a modern refresh!)</li>



<li>Deliver a visually compelling, high-performance user experience across all devices.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Here’s what we delivered</strong>: A sleek, engaging platform that captures the essence of deep-tech startups and positions NIF’s reputation as an industry leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We didn’t just touch the surface; we revamped everything, from the complete strategy and designs to usability and technical performance. The end product is a site that not only looks beautiful but also works seamlessly across all devices.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video aligncenter"><video autoplay loop muted src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/NIF-article-video-v1.mp4" playsinline></video></figure>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-we-built-an-award-winning-website">How We Built an Award-Winning Website</h2>



<p>Our team jumped straight into completely reimagining NIF’s digital presence. Here’s what we did to turn this vision into a reality:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>A Bold, Modern Design:</strong> Out went the old, stiff government-style design, and in came a high-contrast, modern colour palette and clean typography. This new look reflects NIF’s innovative mission while still maintaining a strong, authoritative presence.</li>



<li><strong>Interactive &amp; Engaging Features:</strong> Think subtle animations, smooth scrolling effects, and interactive maps, all carefully placed to deepen the user experience without being overwhelming. The goal was a dynamic but easy-to-navigate journey through the site that keeps users engaged from start to finish.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>User-Focused Functionality:</strong> We made sure that complex investment and funding information didn’t feel like a maze. The content is structured in a way that is intuitive and easy to digest so that startups, investors, and stakeholders can now find what they need quickly and effortlessly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-collaboration-at-its-best-and-bringing-nif-s-vision-to-life">Collaboration at its Best and Bringing NIF’s Vision to Life</h2>



<p>This wasn’t a simple “set it and forget it” project. Solid.5 worked closely with NIF and NATO (<em>yes, NATO!</em>) to ensure we were perfectly aligned at every stage. We held regular feedback sessions, to make sure the site stayed true to their vision, all whilst refining the design and user experience.</p>



<p>By using inspiration from NIF’s initial vision and mood boards, we built a site that strikes the perfect balance between cutting-edge innovation and professional presence, with every element created with precision, usability, and future scalability in mind.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-website-that-wins-literally">A Website That Wins (Literally!)</h2>



<p>Since its launch, the NATO Innovation Fund website has delivered <em>incredible results</em>, including:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A 220% increase in user engagement</li>



<li>Gold Award Win at the  Design Awards</li>



<li>Site of the Day (July 18th, 2024) from <a href="https://www.designnominees.com/sites/nato-innovation-fund">Design Nominees</a></li>

<li>Star Award (July 25th, 2024) from <a href="https://www.csswinner.com/details/nato-innovation-fund/18162">CSS Winner</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond these wins, the site has also been recognised by <a href="https://www.cssdesignawards.com/sites/nato-innovation-fund/45973/">CSS Design Awards</a>, <a href="https://www.csslight.com/website/64766/NATO-Innovation-Fund">CSS Light</a> and <a href="https://orpetron.com/sites/nato-innovation-fund/">Orpetron</a> securing its place as an industry-leading digital project.<br><br>With this 220% increase in user engagement, the numbers speak for themselves.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Back in the 2010s, responsive web design was all very popular. It was the design approach everyone was talking about. But now, just a decade later, it&#8217;s starting to feel a little outdated.</p>



<p>Put simply, responsive web design is all about resizing elements to fit different screen sizes, mainly by scaling desktop layouts down for mobile. However, this approach no longer makes sense in a world that’s obsessed with their phones.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-old-ways-no-longer-work">Why the Old Ways No Longer Work</h2>



<p>For most websites today, mobile traffic dominates. On many projects we work on, around 70% of visitors are using mobile devices. That shift completely changes how we need to think about web design. The old approach, starting with a desktop layout and adjusting it for mobile, no longer works as it treats mobile users as an afterthought.</p>



<p>Think about a typical desktop design with three evenly spaced columns side by side. They look great on desktop but on mobile, those columns typically stack vertically, which on some sites might work fine but for most sites this leads to users endlessly scrolling, making for a frustrating user experience. Today&#8217;s users expect instant access to information and if they don&#8217;t get it, they&#8217;re gone. With platforms like TikTok setting the standard for fast, seamless content consumption, websites need to match that pace. If visitors can&#8217;t find what they need immediately, they won&#8217;t stick around scrolling, they&#8217;ll leave.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="586" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/grid_wireframes-1024x586.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-9252" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/grid_wireframes-1024x586.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/11/grid_wireframes-300x172.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/11/grid_wireframes-768x439.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/11/grid_wireframes-1536x878.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/11/grid_wireframes-576x329.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/11/grid_wireframes-1366x781.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/11/grid_wireframes.webp 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-mobile-first-mindset">The Mobile-First Mindset</h2>



<p>This is where mobile-first design comes in. This means, instead of shrinking desktop layouts, this approach starts with mobile usability in mind first (as most people are using their phone to view your site today). Wireframing, prototyping, and functionality are built for small screens first, ensuring a seamless experience from the get-go and then scaled up for bigger screens.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-shift-to-mobile-optimised-web-design">The Shift to Mobile-Optimised Web Design</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="413" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/carousel_wireframes-1024x413.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-9253" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/carousel_wireframes-1024x413.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/11/carousel_wireframes-300x121.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/11/carousel_wireframes-768x310.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/11/carousel_wireframes-1536x619.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/11/carousel_wireframes-576x232.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/11/carousel_wireframes-1366x551.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/11/carousel_wireframes.webp 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This change to mobile-first responsive web design unlocks a world of creative possibilities. Instead of simply stacking elements like in a traditional responsive framework, mobile-optimised design introduces:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Interactive carousels:</strong> Instead of stacking three columns, users are able to swipe effortlessly between them.</li>



<li><strong>Touch-friendly navigation:</strong> Buttons, sliders, and interactive elements that feel intuitive for finger based browsing.</li>



<li><strong>Smart animations:</strong> Subtle transitions and movements that enhance the user experience without overwhelming it or slowing it down.</li>
</ul>



<p>These techniques reduce excessive scrolling and create a dynamic, user-friendly experience that feels modern and intuitive. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-frameworks-and-flexibility">Frameworks and Flexibility</h2>



<p>Many responsive designs rely on frameworks like <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> to handle stacking and resizing. While these tools are useful, they often create rigid, outdated designs. Off-the-shelf site builders or pre-made themes, only make this worse, leaving brands with a generic design that fails to truly meet their needs.</p>



<p>By contrast, custom-built, mobile-optimised designs (which we happen to specialise in!) offer complete creative freedom. They allow designers to craft experiences tailored to the brand and audience, rather than forcing users into a one-size-fits-all template.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-responsive-design-vs-mobile-optimisation-the-verdict">Responsive Design vs. Mobile Optimisation: The Verdict</h2>



<p>So, is responsive web design still relevant in 2025? Yes, but not in its traditional form.</p>



<p>While all websites must be responsive, simply resizing and stacking elements isn&#8217;t enough anymore. Users expect fast, interactive, mobile-first experiences that cater to their needs, not just a squeezed down version of a desktop site.</p>



<p>For brands and designers looking to stay ahead, the choice is clear: don’t settle for “good enough.” Instead, embrace a mobile-optimised approach to create seamless, engaging experiences that keep users hooked in 2025 and beyond. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="gradient">Website Accessibility And Why It Matters</h3>
<p>According to official <a href="https://www.gov.SA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gov.SA</a> stats, 1 in 5 people in the SA have a disability of some kind.</p>
<p>When building a website the first disability I think most people would consider is visual impairments; however there are plenty of other disabilities that could be considered e.g., hard of hearing, colour blindness or neurological disabilities.</p>
<p>Making sure your website is accessible to your users is not only vital for their user journey, but also, failing to meet accessibility standards can be a breach of the law.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-4" src="/img/W3C.png" alt="Solid.5 - W3C Image" /></p>
<p>The Word Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been developed by individuals and organisations to provide a shared standard for web content and development. These standards are reviewed for accessibility support that meets international needs.</p>
<p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines have been created through the same W3C process to explain to users how they can make their web content more accessible. Web content refers to text, imagery and sounds as well as the code that defines the structure of a website.</p>
<p>For the rest of this article we will refer to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines as ‘WCAG’</p>
<h3 class="gradient">Criteria</h3>
<p><strong>The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 require websites to fulfill these four criteria:</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-4" src="/img/four-points.png" alt="Solid.5 - Accessbility Criteria" /></p>
<p>If accessibility is an important consideration for your website build then you can ask your web designer or developer what they are doing to keep inline with the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).</p>
<p><em>“A new study on Website accessibility found that 97.8% of 1 million homepages tested had detectable WCAG 2 failures.”</em></p>
<p>Below we have listed some of things you can do to make your website more perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. 👀 📖</p>
<p>Following these points will help your website to be as accessible as possible!</p>
<h3>Perceivable</h3>
<ul>
<li>Provide text alternatives for images, videos and other non-text content. This allows screen readers to crawl the site for those who are visually impaired.</li>
<li>The addition of captions, audio description and/or sign language for videos and other media</li>
<li>Make sure the content you create for your site can be adapted by different softwares without losing its meaning</li>
<li>Make it easy for visitors to your site to see and hear your content. This can be done in a variety of ways, but important ones to note are:
<ul class="square">
<li>Contrast! Presentation of text should have at least a ratio of 4.5:1</li>
<li>Try not to use images of text for information purposes.</li>
<li>Use readable fonts, eg sans serif for web content and a minimum of 14 pixels</li>
<li>Ensure there are mechanisms for pausing audio or closing additional content</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="gradient">Operable</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your website&#8217;s users have enough time to read all of your content.</li>
<li>Avoid using content that may cause a seizure to users or a physical reaction.</li>
<li>Help your users to navigate and find content, this can be done by making sure your pages are labelled</li>
<li>Make website functionality available with a keyboard and other softwares and devices.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="gradient">Understandable</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your website content is readable and understandable. You can do this by providing explanations of Jargon or expand on acronyms.</li>
<li>Content needs to be provided in a predictable way. This can be quite simple, like not changing the order of menu items and using navigation for changing content.</li>
<li>Help your users by notifying them and allowing them to correct errors, for example notifications if a submission is required and it is incorrect.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="gradient">Robust</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is your site compatible with current and future user tools?</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately there is not a lot you can do to make sure your site is robust yourself, this is up to your web developers to deliver. However, if they stick to the basic Word Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards you shouldn&#8217;t have a problem.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-4" src="/img/text-image-video.png" alt="Solid.5 - W3C Image" /></p>
<p>Since September 2018 accessibility regulations have been in place for all public sector bodies. While not every single website is required by law to follow these regulations, you must make &#8220;reasonable adjustments&#8221; to try to make sure your site abides to the regulations. As per the official government website:</p>
<p><em>“All SA service providers have a legal obligation to make reasonable adjustments under the Equality Act 2010 or the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (in Northern Ireland).” &#8211; <a href="https://www.gov.SA/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps">https://www.gov.SA/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps</a> </em></p>
<p>We make sure the basics from WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) are included with each site we build. If you are interested in a more in depth look at accessibility then contact the team for more information.</p>
<p>Lets #bemoreaccessible 👏</p>

<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-about-the-nature-reserve">🐒 About the Nature Reserve</h3>



<p>The Upper Rock Nature Reserve in Gibraltar makes up over 40% of the countries’ land area, and is filled with a huge variety of wildlife &amp; attractions.</p>



<p>Visitors can enjoy historic and cultural sites such as military batteries &amp; siege tunnels, explore natural cave systems &amp; take in the stunning views across the mediterranean, and observe the diverse range of animal &amp; plant species that inhabit the island.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-project-details">📃 Project Details</h3>



<p class="mb-4">During the Discovery phase of the project, we looked at ways to highlight all that the Nature Reserve has to offer, both as an important conservation site and a tourist destination.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gib-blog-post-3-1024x1024.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-9080" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gib-blog-post-3-1024x1024.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gib-blog-post-3-300x300.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gib-blog-post-3-150x150.webp 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gib-blog-post-3-768x768.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gib-blog-post-3-576x576.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gib-blog-post-3-24x24.webp 24w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gib-blog-post-3-48x48.webp 48w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gib-blog-post-3-96x96.webp 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gib-blog-post-3.webp 1280w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>We looked at existing websites for other Nature Reserves both in the SA and internationally, to draw some inspiration and identify how we could create a really unique platform.</p>



<p>Designed from the ground up, we collaborated with the team at WTM to create an experience that showcased the extraordinary sights to see at the Nature Reserve, while preserving an easy to use UX for people wanting to purchase tickets or merchandise.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-development-spec">🧑‍💻 Development Spec</h3>



<p>The site is built with a number of advanced features, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list mb-4">
<li>Ecommerce store selling merchandise</li>



<li>Ticket purchases with QR code integration for onsite verifications</li>



<li>Timetable booking &amp; purchase for attractions such as Caving, Private Tours &amp; Dolphin Sightseeing</li>



<li>Bespoke animation &amp; interactive maps</li>



<li>Live webcam feeds &amp; social banners</li>



<li>Permissions system to allow service providers to manage their bookings</li>



<li>Full integration with WordPress Gutenberg Blocks, allowing easy Content Management</li>
</ul>

<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-and-it-s-live">🚀 And it&#8217;s live!</h3>



<p>The Gibraltar Government recently hosted a launch event to unveil the new platform, with ministers, journalists &amp; site officials from Gibraltar attending to ‘cut the digital red ribbon’ &#8211; and ticket purchases have already started flooding in!</p>



<p>We’ve also kicked off SEO &amp; PPC programs for the site, to ensure it gets maximum visibility online and becomes recognised as the Official website to learn about the Reserve &amp; book tickets.</p>



<p>Feedback from both the Gibraltar Government and public has been fantastic. Christian Wright, CEO of Wright Tech Media, writes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“The general population, 3rd party operators and the Government of Gibraltar have expressed their awe at the overall sleekness of the design and ease of functionality. Solid.5 genuinely believed in what we were trying to achieve, and the final product spoke to this ethos. It was a thoroughly enjoyable project and the overall success of the launch proves that the expertise behind the website was top notch.”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p class="mb-4">You can visit the website via the link below to check it out, or even purchase some tickets for a visit yourself. We’ll certainly be over there in the summer!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-purpose-of-mental-models-in-web-design">The Purpose of Mental Models in Web Design</h2>



<p>When we interact with things &#8211; we connect the dots on how it works and what we anticipate happening next, these processes are known as mental models.</p>



<p>Users have different concepts of how things should work on a website based on their experience from other platforms. Hotmail debuted in 1996 and is considered the first major email software. Its design elements consist of letters, symbols and paper aeroplanes which represent email workflows. Nowadays, all providers make use of this similar design system.</p>



<p class="mb-4">As designers, we need to recognize, understand and use past experiences and expectations for user interaction. The user’s preconceived ideas about the platform are an important part of the overall design process, these are the expectations that users have about how the system and the experience will work.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-mental-models-relate-to-ux-design">How do Mental Models relate to UX Design?</h4>



<p>We all know that good UX is about making it as easy as possible for your user, not vice versa. It relies on the designer to create a website model that meets users expectations. The user should know how to encourage or discourage them from adapting to the platform. If the designer wants to do something exciting and original, the user should approach a new product or feature based on how they use the platform, it is called a mental model approach and the designer should work within the expectations of the user.</p>



<p>A mental model is what a user believes will work in the context of UX design. It is built in the user&#8217;s brain based on what they know from previous interactions with websites, mobile phones, and other interactive products.</p>



<p>Mental models are used by UX designers to develop a design experience that makes sense for users. In UX design, mental models are the way users believe the system should work.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="mb-4">Given that we have mental interaction models it is a good rule of thumb to assume that users build their mental models as much as possible on the basis of interactions with existing applications and websites. In short, users expect functionality that is consistent with previous experiences, and if standard patterns exist, they will mimic your design. Designers know that they can make wonderful mental models out of their own creations and lead them to believe that features will be easy to understand.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-examples-of-mental-models">Examples of Mental Models</h4>



<p>A great example of mental models is an iPad. Not all of us have an iPad or tablet but many of us do have an iPhone. Say for example someone gives you an iPad, Apple users will be well versed in how it should work. They will know that to use the device you will have to unlock it with your face, fingerprint or password. They will understand that an App will load if they tap the icon and they will probably need to lock the device again when they are finished.</p>



<p class="mb-4">As many of us have an iPhone we believe that we should know how to correctly use an iPad. We feel confident that we can use it and gain whatever information we require. It is because of the mental model associated with this kind of device that enables us to use it effectively without any prior knowledge.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="468" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AdobeStock_17491692-1024x468.webp" alt="Broad Search" class="wp-image-9072" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AdobeStock_17491692-1024x468.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AdobeStock_17491692-300x137.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AdobeStock_17491692-768x351.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AdobeStock_17491692-576x263.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AdobeStock_17491692-1366x625.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AdobeStock_17491692.webp 1500w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>A secondary example is the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/main-website-navigation-ht" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">navigation of a website</a>. Thanks to mobile browsing and a designer named Norm Cox, we often see a little icon known as a ‘Hamburger’, the three straight lines on thr top right of many website designs. Cox has said it was designed to “mimic the look of the resulting displayed menu list”. Over time however, this symbol has evolved. We can now see many variations, two lines, three dots, a more minimal ‘MENU’ as a four-letter word and in some cases a square.</p>



<p class="mb-4">Due to this associated mental model any symbol would suffice as long as this is positioned in the top right quadrant of the screen. Clicking it will display a series of pages that form the navigation. It is incredibly rare to see this icon anywhere else on the screen. If you dare move it you risk that a user will have a ahrder time using your platform.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-importance-of-mental-models">The Importance of Mental Models</h4>



<p>Whether or not a UX designer adapts to an existing mental model of the user, they ensure that their expectations are met and that the experience with the latest design is as smooth as possible. The system model works best when the interaction model interacts with the one already in use. In this way, everything works in accordance with the expectations of users, they understand what is used and it is not something they have to contend with.</p>



<p>If the designer&#8217;s <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/conceptual-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">conceptual product model</a> does not take into account the user&#8217;s mental model, it is likely that the product will be difficult to learn and use. An example of this is a vehicle that has a good system model but a bad interaction model. If the conceptual model of the products does not match the mental model of the user, the user will find that the product is difficult to get to grips with.</p>



<p>If the conceptual model of the products is not a reflection of the underlying hardware, software or database, it will not match the mental model of the user and the user will find the device hard to learn and use. The primary goal of the designer is to get the user interface to convey to the user the fundamental nature of the system in the form of a precise and useful mental model. Personality is closely linked to reality because users base their predictions on systems like your website, and their mental model plans their future actions based on how it predicts the most appropriate course of action.</p>



<p>Designers can run into this problem when they try to reinvent the wheel in order to try something new. Of course, a good designer will be aware that if something is changed that is fundamental to a mental model it is likely to cause disruptions.</p>



<p class="mb-4">Take the basket icon on an e-commerce website, every single online shop has one. Without it, you cannot easily pay for your goods. If you cannot do that, zero sales. This basket icon will sometimes tell you how many items you have in the basket. They come in many different shapes and sizes but if you move the basket icon from where it usually is: top right, you will see a fall in conversions. This basket placement is now standard practice, and a straight-forward place to save your goods and pay for them or to simply come back to them later.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-benefits-of-mental-models">The Benefits of Mental Models</h4>



<p>Models are our best way to understand complex behaviours and processes. Mental models are inherent in the user&#8217;s brain, and different users construct different mental models of the same user interface. While it is true that most people have different skills and their own particular prior knowledge, what makes each user unique and different is that designers can design different versions of the experience to suit specific users.</p>



<p>UX design is an integrated activity that requires designers to understand, read and understand many things about the customer. With respect to online experiences, users expect to see a certain sequence of events in the light of past encounters and their desired experiences. This helps us to <a href="https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/design-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">develop a design strategy</a> based on what the end-user expects.</p>



<p>A classic example of this pattern is the login to a website where users enter the required information, receive an activation link by e-mail and click on the link to activate their user account.</p>



<p>This in turn leads to a superior user experience, as the user can concentrate on his task, which is much more complex than learning a new model. This leads to the creation of a great user experience where the system behaves as the user expects it to.</p>



<p>Conducting research will enable you to help clarify existing mental models. If you are not testing, you are guessing. Task analysis, observations and simple A/B tests offer a range of different methods to acknowledge user behaviour and ultimately be in the front seat not only for enhancing your products or services but for creating exciting new ones as well.

<p>Diving into the pool that is&nbsp;<strong>Project Management in Web Design</strong>&nbsp;can be a bit of a daunting one! 🤿 So for the sake of this article and my sanity! We are going to start by just dipping our toes in the water.</p>



<p>When I first started my research into project management methodologies in website design, I couldn&#8217;t believe how many there were! I even tried to google exactly how many there were, but there wasn&#8217;t really a clear answer. There were however 5 or 6 popular methods that kept coming up, so those are the ones I am going to look at for this article.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-project-management-methodologies">What Are Project Management Methodologies?</h4>



<p>Let&#8217;s start by asking the most important question&#8230;what does project management methodology actually mean?</p>



<p>A project management methodology is a collection of principles, methods, techniques, and processes that are used to initiate, plan, and execute a project.&nbsp;<em>Sounds simple!</em></p>



<p>You may also read about the term framework though, which is a set of project management processes that are used to initiate, plan and execute a project.&nbsp;<em>Now I&#8217;m confused!</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/img/posts/sponge-bob-patrick-star.gif" alt="In Thought"/></figure>



<p>It took a lot of reading 👀 to wrap my head around this one! But what I gathered is that methodology is a way to systematically solve a problem, whereas a framework is a foundation that is built upon to solve said problem. This will make a bit more sense when we get into some of the methodologies and frameworks below.</p>



<p>Just to add a bit of history into the mix before we move on&#8230;Project management activities have taken place over thousands of years! I wonder what methodology the Egyptians used when they built the pyramids 🤔. Henry Gantt invented the Gantt chart around 1910-1915 which revolutionised project planning, but it wasn&#8217;t until the 1950’s that we began to outline specific project methodologies and frameworks.</p>



<p>Project management methods and frameworks are constantly changing and evolving over time and new concepts appear regularly. During your life you will use more than one of the methods below, even if you don’t know you’ve been doing it!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-six-most-popular-methodologies-and-frameworks">What Are The Six Most Popular Methodologies And Frameworks?</h3>



<p>There are a vast amount of methodologies and frameworks to choose from when web designing, so below I have picked 6 that I saw coming up time and time again.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s get started then&#8230;</p>



<p><strong>Agile (Methodology)</strong></p>



<p>Agile Project Management is all about breaking up a project into several phases and working through those phases iteratively until the project is complete. The idea of the Agile methodology is to deliver the project in small bite sized pieces. This means as you move along you are constantly evaluating and improving your processes to deliver the project faster and with fewer headaches! 🤯</p>



<p><strong>Lean (Methodology)</strong></p>



<p>The importance of the Lean project management methodology is identifying the value to the customer and making sure everyone is working towards the same goal.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="726" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/customer-perspectives-1024x726.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-9055" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/customer-perspectives-1024x726.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/customer-perspectives-300x213.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/customer-perspectives-768x544.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/customer-perspectives-576x408.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/customer-perspectives.webp 1177w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><em>Image Source:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://search.google.com/test/rich-results">projectcartoon.com</a></em></p>



<p>When using the Lean methodology, client communication is essential. Constant communication allows project managers to clarify anything that is unclear, resolve conflicts and collaborate on ideas. A more streamlined approach to project management eliminates waste and increases client satisfaction.</p>



<p><strong>Scrum (Framework)</strong></p>



<p>Now when you see the word scrum your mind might head straight to rugby&#8230;🏉 In rugby a scrum is a method of restarting play in rugby that involves players packing closely together with their heads down while they attempt to gain possession of the ball.&nbsp;<em>We can see where Scrum got its name!</em></p>



<p>Scrum is a form of Agile project management, therefore we should consider Scrum to actually be a framework. It involves using a small self-managed multidisciplinary team, which is led by a&nbsp;<strong>Scrum master.</strong>&nbsp;The scrum master essentially runs the projects and makes sure to remove any obstacles that might slow the rest of the team down.</p>



<p>The project is broken down into short cycles or sprints and the team meets daily to discuss each sprint; the current tasks and discuss potential upcoming roadblocks. These meetings are usually called&nbsp;<strong>stand ups.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/img/posts/rugby-scrum.gif" alt="Rugby Scrum"/></figure>



<p><strong>Kanban (Framework)</strong></p>



<p>Kanban is another framework that falls under the Agile methodology, but its processes can also be used by those using the Lean methodology. Kanban was developed by Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, to manage their manufacturing process more efficiently.&nbsp;<em>My Yaris and I thank you Taiichi!</em></p>



<p>Kanban is about visualising the project to see a breakdown of tasks that are outstanding, in progress and complete. Kanban usually consists of a physical or digital board with 3 or more columns with tasks illustrated as cards that can be moved between columns depending on status.</p>



<p>The main goal of Kanban is to increase knowledge of work in progress, limit multitasking and eliminate waste. This is why it is often used for the Lean methodology.</p>



<p><strong>Scrumban (Framework)</strong></p>



<p>I think we can probably take a wild guess at what Scrumban is, but just in case.. Scrumban is a combination of both Scrum and Kanban frameworks. Scrumban involves applying the visual elements of Kanban and the flexible approach to the structured scrum method.</p>



<p><strong>Waterfall (Methodology)</strong></p>



<p>Waterfall project management is another methodology. Waterfall is often described as the most straightforward way to manage a project!&nbsp;<em>Sounds good to me!</em></p>



<p>The Waterfall method is where a project is broken up into distinct phases which are laid out sequentially, so the next phase doesn’t begin until the previous phase has been marked as complete.</p>



<p>Waterfall involved using a team, each with a defined role, to complete each phase. Usually with the waterfall method, the phases are set and unlikely to change throughout the project.</p>



<p>The waterfall methodology is actually what we use for most of our website builds! We split each of our builds into 6 distinct phases. A phase is marked as complete when it is signed off and we move onto the next phase. You can see more about our 6 phase approach&nbsp;<a href="/services/website-design/">here</a>.</p>

<p></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-welcome-subjects">Welcome, Subjects.</h4>



<p>It’s Halloween season, and things are going bump in the night. Hopefully not my Slack channels, but that’s for another day…</p>



<p>While everyone’s in the mood for spooky nights &amp; ghoulish frights, let’s talk about <em>Headlessness</em>. You might’ve heard the term Headless CMS bandied about amongst web circles, plastered all over some very techy articles about the evolution of frontend dev (dull, right!) or even perhaps in a written proposal as a prospective client.</p>



<p class="mb-4">But what does it actually <em>mean</em>? Don’t worry, I’m not going to rope you into our secret Headless society. We’re just going to have a quick chat about what a CMS actually is, the benefits of it, and why a Headless one might be a good choice for your next project &#8211; without all the confusing technical jargon you’ll read elsewhere.</p>



<p><em>One Of Us…</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-a-cms">What is a CMS?</h3>



<p>Websites have come a long way from <em>Hello World</em>. The underlying code behind most of your favourite sites is probably a big garbled mess of strange looking functions, tags that don’t seem to make any sense and scripts that look like alien communications. So how on earth do webmasters actually manage to populate it all with their latest muses, marketing jargon and glorious photography?</p>



<p>With a <strong>Content Management System</strong>, of course.</p>



<p>There are a multitude of CMS services to choose from &#8211; some paid, and some free of charge. Here at Solid.5 we’re WordPress experts (a completely <strong>Free, Open Source CMS</strong>), so let’s dive into WordPress and what it is &#8211; and also, what it isn’t.</p>



<p><em>There seem to be 2 WordPresses… which one do we use?</em></p>



<p class="mb-4">Well spotted! There are 2 versions of WordPress &#8211; WordPress.com, and WordPress.org.</p>



<div class="row">
<figure><img decoding="async" class="mb-4" src="/img/posts/wordpresscom.jpg" alt="WordPress.com - bad!"></figure><div class="col-lg-6"></div>
<figure><img decoding="async" class="mb-4" src="/img/posts/wordpressorg.jpg" alt="WordPress.org - good!"></figure><div class="col-lg-6"></div>
</div>



<p>WordPress.com is not actually a CMS… Well, not <em>really</em>. It’s what I’d call a Freemium Site Builder. Other examples of these include services like Squarespace, Wix, Weebly &#8211; even GoDaddy now offer their own. It’s a great choice for small / solo businesses looking to get a cheap &amp; cheerful website up &amp; running in a short time. There are a bunch of pre-coded themes to choose from, so you can pick one that suits your style and there’s not much technical knowledge required to get started.</p>



<p>We don’t use WordPress.com.</p>



<p>As mentioned, it’s a great service to get a small site up quickly without the faff &#8211; but it’s not built to handle enterprise-level websites, and doing anything bespoke or unique is impossible.</p>



<p>This is where WordPress.org steps in!</p>



<p>The WordPress we know and love here at CBD is a fully-fledged CMS solution that allows complete control of every aspect of the website. Totally unique design? Yep. Unlimited scalability &amp; your choice of web hosting? Yep. Terribly complex custom backend system that leaves your devs head-scratching for many days &amp; full-mooned nights? You got it.</p>



<p>For the rest of this article I’ll just be referring to WordPress.org as <strong>WP</strong>.</p>



<p class="mb-4">The most common use case of WP for us is with Custom ‘Gutenberg’ Blocks. We design websites completely from scratch, then code each section into said Blocks that can be added, removed &amp; rearranged on the site as the web admin sees fit &#8211; with input fields for every piece of content imaginable. You get all the benefits of a bespoke website, with the ease of use of a site builder. It sounds great, because it is. <a href="/portfolio">We’re pretty cool!</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="429" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gutenberg-1024x429.webp" alt="Gutenberg Block Editor" class="wp-image-9065" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gutenberg-1024x429.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gutenberg-300x126.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gutenberg-768x322.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gutenberg-1536x644.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gutenberg-576x241.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gutenberg-1366x573.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gutenberg-1600x671.webp 1600w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gutenberg.webp 1756w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>While this is great for a lot of websites, so far nothing has been very <em>spooky</em>. And that’s the whole point of this article &#8211; so let’s get to it.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-wordpress-bad-at">What is WordPress bad at?</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-can-be-sluggish">🐌 It can be sluggish.</h4>



<p>Ok, so WordPress in its most basic form isn’t <em>that</em> slow. When we code our WP sites we try to keep the bit you actually view as minimal &amp; lightweight as possible. Site Speed is a priority for us, and as <a href="/services/-seo-company/">SEO Experts</a> we know first-hand how it can affect your Core Vitals and thus ranking on Google, as well as things like Bounce Rates. However, because of WP’s vast plugin library, it can sometimes be difficult to keep on top of loading times. Even the most basic of plugins can add huge amounts of unnecessary bloat &amp; overhead to your lovely clean website.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-can-be-hacked">🐛 It can be hacked.</h4>



<p>Honestly, any website can be hacked, and WP sites are no exception. Nearly 500 million websites are built on WP though, which makes the core code a popular target for nefarious scripters. The core of WP is actually pretty secure &#8211; again, most issues here arise from things like plugins bringing unknown, possibly untested code to your site. We do all we can to mitigate any security vulnerabilities, using AntiVirus &amp; Firewall services like WordFence and bot blocking tools like reCaptcha &#8211; but there’s always a chance some sneaky mole finds its way through a hole opened by a plugin or piece of code bolted onto the site. Nobody wants their page links directing off to NSFW content, but sadly we’ve seen, and been commissioned to fix, plenty such examples &#8211; especially on low-cost, low-quality servers.</p>



<p>(I’ll take this opportunity to plug our <a href="/services/hosting/">Hosting Services</a> &#8211; we’ve got some of the most hardened anti-hacking tech around, not to mention our dedicated AWS servers are really quite fast.)</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-development-tech-is-limited">👩‍💻 Development tech is limited.</h4>



<p>This is one of the main considerations of why a Headless CMS might be the way to go. WordPress is generally fine, as long as you want your site coded in some fairly old-school tech. We’re talking bog standard PHP, HTML, CSS &amp; JS &#8211; the same stuff websites have been built with since PC’s were the size of a <a href="https://twitter.com/SheriffAlert/status/1221881862244749315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small boulder</a>. There are more frontend frameworks now than candies in a trick-or-treat basket, and precisely <em>none</em> of them will play nicely with old-school WordPress. So if you want your site to be ultra-modern, you’re out of luck.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-is-a-headless-cms">So &#8211; What is a Headless CMS?</h3>



<p class="mb-4">We could describe the standard WP setup as a <strong>Monolith</strong>. It’s a bit of a beast, with a lot going on under the hood, and contains all the source code and all the CMS-ness under one roof. That’s quite convenient, usually. If we think of it as a body (modeled here so gracefully by a Spooky Scary Skeleton) &#8211; we’ve got the <strong>Head</strong> &#8211; all the actual code to make the site work &#8211; the <em>brain</em>, if you like &#8211; and the <strong>Body</strong> (the CMS and all the site content &#8211; output is controlled by the brain, gettit?)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skeleton-1024x576.webp" alt="CMS Skeleton Model" class="wp-image-9066" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skeleton-1024x576.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skeleton-300x169.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skeleton-768x432.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skeleton-576x324.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/10/skeleton.webp 1280w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Chopping the Head off the website might sound fairly medieval and destructive, but in fact it’s quite the opposite. What a Headless CMS does is decouple the Content Management from the Front End Code &#8211; enabling us developers to code the site using any technology of our choosing, and freeing it from the restrictions and downsides of a traditional, monolithic setup. Henry the Eighth ain’t got nothing on us.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-this-a-good-thing">Why is this a good thing?</h3>



<p>There are a number of reasons why a Headless CMS setup can be beneficial for a website &#8211; for the webmasters, developers and most importantly the end user.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-infinitely-flexible">➰ Infinitely Flexible</h4>



<p>At first glance, being able to choose any frontend technology to build the site sounds like something only the developers would care about. And trust me, we do care. But &#8211; what if you fancy a change, or need to upscale down the line and redo your site? With a monolithic setup, all your site content is going to be lost, or have to be painstakingly migrated over to the new version.</p>



<p>By using a Headless CMS, the content can stay right where it is within the CMS &#8211; while all the underlying code for it to work is given a makeover. It lets you do pretty much whatever you want with the website, whilst your content remains untouched. Want a site built in React, Vue, or (if you’re trendy) Svelte? It doesn’t matter! It’s not magic &#8211; just tech.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-speeeed">🚀 Speeeed!</h4>



<p>We know from earlier that monolithic WordPress sites aren’t inherently slow. The thing is, Headless sites can be <strong>much faster</strong>.</p>



<p>There are two main types of Headless tech stack &#8211; SSR and SSG. We’ll talk about those briefly a bit later, but SSG sites are as zippy as they come when they are coded well &#8211; to a point that a standard CMS will never be able to touch.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security">🔐 Security</h4>



<p class="mb-4">Aside from speed, SSG sites are <em>really hard</em> to hack. The reasons for this relate to speed, too, so I’ll explain further in the next section. Basically &#8211; because the content and all the database info is safely tucked away in the Body of the site (not the Head!) &#8211; it can’t be accessed or manipulated by the end user, at all.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/img/posts/benefits.jpg" alt="Headless CMS Benefits"/></figure>



<p></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-interoperability">📱 Interoperability</h4>



<p>Ok, so you’ve got a great website and your business is booming. Thing is, all the cool kids these days have <em>Apps</em>. You can fork out for an App to be developed &#8211; we don’t currently do this, but can point you in the right direction &#8211; but you don’t really want to double the workload of your Content Manager / Web Admin team.</p>



<p>With a Headless CMS, you can use all the same stuff for any sort of platform you wish &#8211; all at the same time! So if you want your content to be consistent &amp; updated in real-time across your website, app, game, digital billboard, audiobook (ok&#8230; no idea about this one) &#8211; and you probably do &#8211; then a Headless CMS can do that.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-interactivity">😍 Interactivity</h4>



<p>I did say earlier that we can build sites on WP that are completely bespoke &amp; not tied to any theme or design &#8211; and that’s absolutely true. There are a few caveats though. Most fashionable sites these days are built with a Javascript framework, which opens up a whole world of possibility in terms of fancy effects and functionality. If you head over to something like <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">awwwards</a> (where we’ve got <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/creativebranddesign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our own page</a>!) you’ll see a lot of wizardry taking place on many of the sites &#8211; this is usually achieved, though not always, by coding in a JS framework.</p>



<p>If you’re a dev who’s ever tried to set up Push-State AJAX Page Navigation in WordPress &#8211; you’ll know what I mean. It’s a struggle. 😫</p>



<p>Due to the nature of a Headless CMS allowing us to pick any coding technology we like, some things are just easier to achieve. And that’s great news if you want your site to be all singing, all dancing in the vein of those that are found on Awards boards.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-does-a-headless-cms-actually-work">How does a Headless CMS actually work?</h3>



<p class="mb-6">There are 2 main types of Headless setup &#8211; Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG). Those are a bit of a mouthful, so I’ll try to keep it simple.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-server-side-rendered">Server Side Rendered</h4>



<p class="mb-6">SSR is the closer of the two to a traditional setup. The site content is held in the CMS Database, as you’d expect, and when a page is loaded that content is fetched and displayed on the page! Great… sort of. You see, the improvements available to Site Speed by using a Headless CMS are significantly hampered by having an SSR setup. Every time the site is loaded, all the content has to be pulled in from the web server &#8211; making a bunch of requests and taking a fair chunk of time. There are situations where it’s better, or even important to use SSR &#8211; but generally, for most sites it’s best avoided.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-static-site-generation">Static Site Generation</h4>



<p>SSG is what really straps rocket boosters to your website. Essentially, it’s like having no Database at all &#8211; and thus no requests to the content server when the site is loaded. Everything is already nicely in place, so the only things the user needs to load on their device are the raw pages themselves. So then, how does the content actually appear? It’s not summoned from beyond the grave or carried in on a broomstick &#8211; some clever functions known as <strong>Webhooks</strong> grab it for us.</p>



<p>Each time a content or visual update is made, the site is <em>compiled</em> (or generated). A bundling software packaged into the frontend goes off to the content server and fetches the fresh content from the database, before rebuilding the site into plain HTML files with it all up to date and in place. This doesn’t bring the site down &#8211; the whole process happens in the background in a matter of seconds &#8211; and the updated site is then served to visitors straight away.</p>



<p>Both methods use an API for fetching the data &#8211; with WordPress, that can be the native WP REST API or a GraphQL API that works a little differently. There are alternative CMS available &#8211; such as <strong>Contentful</strong> or <strong>Strapi</strong> &#8211; but they all generally work the same way. And as mentioned &#8211; because both methods simply use the API to fetch the content, rather than being bundled in with the database itself, they are inherently more secure than a traditional, monolithic setup.</p>



<p>This is starting to stray into the realms of <em>dev-speak</em>, so let’s return to the real world.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-might-you-not-want-a-headless-cms">Why might you <em>not</em> want a Headless CMS?</h3>



<p>Ok, so we’ve covered plenty of reasons why a Headless CMS could benefit your website. Believe it or not, though, there are situations where it might be better not to use one &#8211; if you fit into any of the following, you might need to think twice:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-need-previews">👀 You need Previews!</h4>



<p>One great feature of WordPress is the ability to preview pages &amp; posts when you’re updating content, without actually publishing them to the live website. If you’re regularly getting stuck into the site and switching things out, this can be helpful to double check that nothing’s going to go awry while doing so.</p>



<p>Setting up live previews that pull fresh content from a Headless API can be a huge pain for the developers to get working correctly, so if you absolutely need this feature you might want to stick with a standard CMS.</p>



<p>Remember that both setups can work independently of a ‘staging’, or test environment, which is a great alternative to a Preview Mode if you need to make wholesale updates to your site.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-don-t-need-a-cms-at-all">😎 You don’t need a CMS at all.</h4>



<p>What kind of a website wouldn’t use a CMS, you might ask?</p>



<p>Well, you’re currently looking at one!</p>



<p>If you’ve got people on your team comfortable with delving into raw, coded pages and amending content on the fly, it can be a better option to forgo a CMS completely and just use a simple file-routing system to serve the website. This avoids database calls (the same way that an SSG-based Headless setup does), and offers similar security and site speed benefits.</p>



<p>The same might also apply if your site is very bare-bones, and you really don’t need to touch the content very often &#8211; it might not be worth the extra faff of using a CMS.</p>



<p class="mb-4">What you <em>don&#8217;t</em> get is the ability to reuse your content cross-platform or in a reskinned website, which could throw a rather large spanner in the works in the future.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nocms-1024x576.webp" alt="Raw Code Screenshot" class="wp-image-9069" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nocms-1024x576.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nocms-300x169.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nocms-768x432.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nocms-576x324.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nocms.webp 1280w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-re-ichabod-crane">🎃 You’re Ichabod Crane</h4>



<p>Indeed, if you’d have mentioned the possibility to someone in the 1800’s they’d have looked at you very strangely &#8211; though we’d imagine that Mr. Crane would’ve steered well clear of anything Headless. If you’re a bit old-school and just want a simple, no-frills package that’s easy to understand and keep on top of, a standard CMS such as our regular WordPress sites might be just the ticket.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>To summarise&#8230;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-headless-cms-are-great-if-you-want-a-super-modern-fast-secure-amp-scalable-platform-that-connects-your-entire-digital-presence-under-one-roof">Headless CMS are great if you want a super modern, fast, secure &amp; scalable platform that connects your entire digital presence under one roof.</h3>



<p>Sounds good? We think so. We’re certainly not afraid, at least &#8211; and you shouldn’t be either. That’s why we offer a Headless WordPress installation &amp; system as one of our web build options, alongside our tried &amp; tested monolith.</p>



<p>You will usually find that we will ask for a bit more time &amp; money to create a website in this way, as it does indeed take a bit longer to put together &#8211; but in our opinion, for the right project the benefits in the long term far outweigh the initial extra outlay.</p>

<p>The post <a href="/seo/5-reasons-why-yoast-green-dots-dont-necessarily-mean-rankings/">5 Reasons Why Yoast Green Dots Do Not Guarantee Rankings</a> appeared first on <a href="">CreativeWeb</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When it comes to SEO plugins, <a href="https://yoast.com/">Yoast</a> is a go-to choice and for good reason. It’s easy to use, packed with handy features, and helps guide you through optimising your content. However, getting that green dot does <em>not</em> guarantee rankings!</p>



<p>So, let’s take a look at why Yoast’s green dots are not the answer to SEO success, and what really matters when it comes to ranking on Google.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-your-keywords-do-not-match-your-users-intent">1- Your keywords do not match your users intent</h2>



<p>Getting a green dot in Yoast feels satisfying, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean your page will rank high. One of the biggest mistakes people make with SEO is putting high focus on keyword placement over user intent. Before you start optimising your site, take a step back and ask yourself: What is the user <em>actually</em> looking for when they type this question into Google?</p>



<p>Google has become incredibly sophisticated over the years at understanding user intent, and it provides different types of content based on what users expect. If you’re targeting the wrong intent, you’re only setting yourself up to fail, and it doesn&#8217;t matter how many times you squeeze your keyword into the page.</p>



<p>These are the four main types of search intent:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong data-start="744" data-end="761">Informational</strong>: Users are looking for answers, like “How does SEO work?” or “Best ways to speed up a website.” These searches typically highlight guides, blog posts, and explainer videos.</li>



<li><strong data-start="942" data-end="959">Investigative</strong>: These users are researching options, comparing services, and reading reviews. Questions like “Best SEO agencies in ” or “Yoast vs Rank Math” fit here.</li>



<li><strong data-start="1121" data-end="1138">Transactional</strong>: The user is ready to take action, whether that’s making a purchase, booking a service, or signing up. Think “Buy running shoes online” or “Affordable SEO packages.”</li>



<li><strong data-start="1314" data-end="1330">Navigational</strong>: These searches are brand-specific, like “Nike website” or “Solid.5 SEO services.”</li>
</ul>



<p>Aside from the four search intents above, users do also complete earlier, more broader searches with less specific terms and these searches return a wide range of different information. These terms tend to be used much earlier on in the user&#8217;s search journey and are less likely to convert.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example of search intent and the kind of results Google will display:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If we search for ‘Technical SEO’ (<em>which is a navigational search</em>), Google will show a description on what Technical SEO is and why it is important.</li>



<li>However, if we search for  “How to technically optimise a page for SEO” (<em>which is informational search</em>) Google will give us a list of factors you need to know about how to optimise a page. On this results page there will be bullet points, many mentions of ‘factors’ and articles that contain the answer to the question.</li>



<li>And if we search for ‘Technical SEO Services’ (<em>which is investigative search</em>) we will get a list of companies providing this service.</li>
</ul>



<p>In order to get great rankings, you need to fully understand your users&#8217; intent and you need to understand what type of content Google is most likely to present them with.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="518" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-1-1024x518.webp" alt="yoast user intent" class="wp-image-9094" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-1-1024x518.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-1-300x152.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-1-768x388.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-1-1536x777.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-1-2048x1035.webp 2048w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-1-576x291.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-1-1366x691.webp 1366w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-1-1600x809.webp 1600w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-1-1920x971.webp 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>So, you have ensured that the term is in the header, metadata, alt tag and you have that green dot&#8230;Great! But the term you are using is less likely to convert and you are not matching your users intent&#8230;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-not-every-page-needs-to-be-optimised">2 &#8211; Not every page needs to be optimised</h2>



<p>Not every page on your website needs to rank on Google, and forcing a keyword onto every single one just to get that green dot can do more harm than good. Pages like Contact Us, Privacy Policy, About Us, and Archive pages are not designed to attract organic traffic, so why waste your time optimising them?</p>



<p>Before you tweak a page just to satisfy Yoast, take a step back and ask yourself:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong data-start="440" data-end="481">Does this page actually need to rank?</strong></li>



<li><strong data-start="486" data-end="558">Will users engage with this page, and could it lead to a conversion?</strong></li>



<li><strong data-start="563" data-end="644">What keyword would I even optimise this for, and does it match search intent?</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Google prioritises relevance over technical optimisation. Even if you get a green dot on your Contact page, it won’t magically rank if the content isn’t relevant to searchers. Worse still, trying to rank a page that doesn&#8217;t align with user intent can lead to a high bounce rate as users arrive and realise it&#8217;s not what they were looking for, then leave immediately.</p>



<p>Instead of focusing on getting everything to rank, put your energy into the pages that actually matter: Your service pages, blog posts, and landing pages which is where users are most likely to convert.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-semantic-synonyms-and-related-terms-are-more-important-than-ever-before">3 &#8211; Semantic/synonyms and related terms are more important than ever before!</h2>



<p>Although Yoast is now much more sophisticated in terms of keywords/semantic terms and closely related terms, the premise is still to make sure that your main keyword is in all of the main page factors.</p>



<p>Google uses semantic keywords to better understand the relevancy of your page and the types of searches that it would be most useful ranking for. Google will make connections between the terms you are using and will be able to build a much better picture of the content you are providing and what it is useful for, therefore helping it to rank better for the most relevant terms. Only focusing on or including the focus term could mean you are missing out on rankings elsewhere and that you are making it more difficult for Google to understand the use of your content.</p>



<p>In 2013 Google launched the Hummingbird Algorithm update. Before this, Google had looked for the keywords within the page. For example, if you wrote an article about Dairy Farming and repeated the term over and over again, Google would understand that the article was about Dairy Farming.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="615" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-2-1024x615.webp" alt="yoast repeat keywords" class="wp-image-9100" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-2-1024x615.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-2-300x180.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-2-768x461.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-2-576x346.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-2.webp 1034w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Now, Google doesn’t just scan for one keyword, it looks for a web of related terms. If you’re writing about Dairy Farming, it expects to see words like Cows, Agriculture, Job Description, Production, Industry. These supporting terms help search engines grasp the broader meaning of your content and determine what kinds of searches it should rank for.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="615" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-3-1024x615.webp" alt="yoast landing pages" class="wp-image-9103" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-3-1024x615.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-3-300x180.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-3-768x461.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-3-576x346.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yoast-3.webp 1034w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>This is why keyword stuffing is dead and content quality is king. Writing naturally and including relevant supporting terms helps Google understand your content the way a human would, which is exactly what leads to better rankings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-image-alt-text-should-describe-your-image">4 &#8211; Image Alt Text should describe your image</h2>



<p>Alt text (or alternative text) is there to help screen readers and search engines understand what an image represents. It improves accessibility for visually impaired users and helps Google index your images properly.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="245" height="115" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/img-alt-yoast.webp" alt="yoast img alt" class="wp-image-9105" style="width:261px;height:auto"/></figure>



<p></p>



<p>If your keyword fits naturally into the description, great! But forcing your focus phrase into every alt tag, even when it doesn’t make sense can harm rather than help your SEO. Keyword stuffing in alt text doesn’t just look unnatural; it can also send the wrong signals to search engines, making your content seem spammy rather than helpful.</p>



<p>Yoast often suggests adding your focus keyword to alt text wherever possible to get that all-important green dot. But here’s the reality: alt text should describe what’s in the image, not just act as another place to shove in keywords.</p>



<p>A better approach would be to write alt text that’s descriptive and useful. Think about how you’d explain the image to someone who can’t see it, because that’s exactly what it’s for.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-always-write-for-humans-first">5 &#8211; Always write for humans first</h2>



<p>At the end of the day, great content is about answering questions, solving problems, and keeping your audience engaged, not just ticking SEO boxes.</p>



<p>Yes, making sure your keyword appears in your URL, meta title, description, and headers is important. But if your content doesn’t actually answer the user’s question, it’s not going to rank well, no matter how many green dots you get.</p>



<p>Google’s algorithms have evolved way beyond simple keyword matching. They now analyse context, readability, and user engagement, meaning that well-written, valuable content will always win over keyword stuffing.</p>



<p>Think of Yoast as spellcheck for SEO, it’s a useful tool, but it doesn’t guarantee rankings. It still relies on older keyword density formulas, which don’t always align with how modern search engines evaluate content. So while it’s nice to see those green dots, remember that SEO success isn’t measured in colours but measured in rankings, traffic, and conversions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-introduction">Introduction</h2>



<p>The average internet user may not notice it day by day, but web design trends are always changing. Here at CreativeWeb, our work this year has seen an increased use of mobile-first design, engaging graphics, and stronger focus on the customer journey.</p>



<p>Below are 8 trends that I foresee being widely implemented. So, let’s take a closer look at what each one entails, as well as some real-world examples!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-dark-mode">1. Dark Mode</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="614" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ring-road-1024x614.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-9112" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ring-road-1024x614.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ring-road-300x180.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ring-road-768x460.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ring-road-576x345.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ring-road.webp 1331w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Dark mode is a low-light user interface that uses a dark colour as the main background colour. It’s the reversal of a typical white layout that designers have used for many years. In response to the increasing number of hours we spend on our phones, designers have discovered that dark theme layouts help with eye strain, especially in low-light surroundings.</p>



<p>Already a massive trend in 2020, dark mode is ready to become more even popular in 2021 too. Here are some reasons why designers love dark mode:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It looks super-modern. Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Apple are just a handful of brands that offer alternative themes on their platforms;</li>



<li>It highlights and allows other design elements to <em>pop</em>;</li>



<li>It incorporates a stylish and mysterious appearance that contributes to a website’s unique appearance;</li>



<li>Easier on the eyes than traditional brighter screens, especially in a low-light environment;</li>



<li>Reduces eye strain in low-light conditions;</li>



<li>It can even save your mobile device’s battery power!</li>
</ul>



<p>Dark mode is being implemented more and more, in mobile apps as well as website layouts. Not all website users prefer dark mode and some will want to switch back and forth between dark and light. Irrespective of how or why you are using dark mode, users should be able to toggle the feature on or off. Dark mode should be a preference, not a requirement.</p>



<p>It’s important to note, whether or not you decide to cross over to the dark side, the decision should be based on the requirements of your audience, your brand’s message, and how people interact with your website.</p>



<p>There’s no denying that dark mode is an emerging trend. Expect this trend to continue well into 2021</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-organic-shapes">2. Organic Shapes</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/organic-shape.gif?x76480" alt="" class="wp-image-19304"/></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Credit: <u>Pinterest</u> ( <u>https://</u> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.pinterest.co.SA</span> ) </em></p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>There’s more to shapes than meets the eye when it comes to web design. Organic shapes are powerful design elements that go a long way in establishing a company’s online visual identity.</p>



<p>Shapes help web designers add interest and organise content in a visually appealing way – leading the eye to the most significant sections of a website. But more than that, shapes can effectively be used to communicate a brand’s vision, identity, goals, and ultimately, drive conversions and sales.</p>



<p>Incorporating organic shapes will certainly help make page elements stand out. They have a tendency to be based on nature, but free drawn elements can capture spontaneity, which is attractive on a website page.</p>



<p>With continued improvements in web technology, it’s become simpler for designers to step outside the typical ‘grid’ parameters to express brand identity.</p>



<p>We have slowly started to pull away from straight lines that came with flat design, and are now moving into experimenting with fluid lines and shapes.</p>



<p>We’re talking about shapes that don’t even have a name, shapes that have shed their straight lines and instead emulate elements of life and nature. Geometric shapes provide structure while organic shapes evoke a feeling of life through the illusion of movement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-micro-interactions-amp-animations">3. Micro Interactions &amp; Animations</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/micro-animation.gif?x76480" alt="" class="wp-image-19303"/></figure></div>


<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>  </strong> <em>Credit: Oleg Frolov ( https://dribbble.com/Volorf )</em></p>



<p>If micro-interactions are only miniature design elements, why to care about them at all? Attention to details is what basically differs an exceptional website from an ordinary one. Here are a few reasons why micro-interactions are a must in 2021:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>They give tips to your users (in the form of a tooltip);</li>



<li>They make it easier for users to interact with your website;</li>



<li>They help make the user experience much more rewarding;</li>



<li>They communicate information about certain elements, e.g. whether or not it’s interactive;</li>



<li>They provide immediate and relevant feedback about a completed action to a user;</li>



<li>They encourage sharing, liking, and commenting on your content;</li>



<li>They direct users’</li>
</ul>



<p>Call to Action micro-interactions essentially nudges the user to interact with an application or website. Call to action instils a feeling of achievement and also an empathy factor in user behaviour, and the best way to make your user interact with CTA’s is to make it engaging to entice interest of user.</p>



<p><u>4 Components of Micro-interactions</u></p>



<p><u>Triggers</u> Are what cause the micro-interaction.</p>



<p>(Think of it as plugging in your phone charger, that’s a trigger).</p>



<p><u>Rules</u> Define how a micro-interaction reacts or what’s supposed to happen after it’s triggered. (In our case, the phone starts charging).</p>



<p><u>Feedback</u> Notifies the user what is happening during the micro-interaction.</p>



<p>(Here, the short ping sound made by the phone and charging animation indicating its charging).</p>



<p><u>Loops and Modes</u> Defines how a micro-interaction reacts when it’s being used repetitively and the different ways a micro-interaction plays out.</p>



<p>Micro-interactions have a lot of potential that designers often overlook. If given the right focus, these micro-interactions, paired with a well-planned design, can improve user engagement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-simple-data-visualizations">4. Simple Data Visualizations</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="1023" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/simple-.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-9115" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/simple-.webp 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/simple--293x300.webp 293w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/simple--768x786.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/simple--576x589.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/simple--24x24.webp 24w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/simple--48x48.webp 48w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>Communicating data in an engaging way can sometimes prove challenging. It’s certainly worth the struggle because it takes advantage of the fact that people are generally more responsive to visual elements, enabling you to convey your message about a service or product much more effectively.</p>



<p>What is Data Visualization? Data visualization is a graphical demonstration of your data that engage your viewers, helping them to want to learn more about your offering. Visual elements such as infographics, scatter graphs, charts and heat maps are some of the most popular ways to bring data to life.</p>



<p>Sharing information has become part and parcel of every business’ marketing strategy. More often than not, data isn’t just internally shared – potential consumers can be encouraged to become paying customers through data.</p>



<p>But sharing raw data holds little value to the viewer, you need to give it context so it’s easy to understand. You must however make sure it’s visually appealing – people don’t want to see a list of numbers or long paragraphs of text, data needs to be easily absorbed or people will simply scroll past.</p>



<p>This is why data visualizations have become so essential to visual marketing strategies. And for 2021, it will be simple visualizations that entice people to engage with your message. Today web designers and developers alike, can count on plenty of options when creating interactive graphical presentations of information using languages and tools like CSS, Javascript, jQuery, etc.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-thumb-friendly-mobile-navigation">5. Thumb-Friendly Mobile Navigation</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="896" height="590" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/thumb-friendly.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-9120" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/thumb-friendly.webp 896w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/thumb-friendly-300x198.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/thumb-friendly-768x506.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/thumb-friendly-576x379.webp 576w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px" /></figure></div>


<p><strong> &nbsp; </strong></p>



<p>Responsive design simply isn’t an option anymore. Your website should work well and be easy to use on mobile devices. However, in 2021, website designs will continue to be focused on creating layouts that are thumb-friendly.</p>



<p><u>What exactly is “thumb-friendly”?</u></p>



<p>We’re talking about the way we use our phones. If you’re reading this article on your phone right now, look at how you’re holding it. Your fingers are likely wrapped around the back of your phone (or around a phone grip), leaving your thumb to do all the work. It’s important to understand how users typically hold their mobile phones and then incorporate this into your mobile web design. Here are the three main ways users hold their phones:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>One-handed, using the same thumb on that hand;</li>



<li>One-handed, cradling the phone using the opposite thumb or forefinger;</li>



<li>Two-handed, using the thumbs on both</li>
</ol>



<p>The ‘thumb zone’ is the area on a mobile screen that is easily reached by the thumbs. The natural part of this zone covers the central portion of the screen and downward since this area is easy to reach using the thumbs for both right and left-hand users. The further away from the natural zone a user must reach, the more difficult navigating a mobile website can be.</p>



<p>The main goal for effective <em>mobile </em>web design is to keep the most important functions within the central and lower thumb zone where they can be easily used, regardless of how the user chooses to hold their device. This may be easier said than done, especially the way mobile screens are continually growing in size while thumb reach remains the same.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-progressive-lead-nurturing-amp-dynamic-forms">6. Progressive Lead Nurturing &amp; Dynamic Forms</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="426" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/forms-1024x426.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-9123" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/forms-1024x426.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/forms-300x125.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/forms-768x319.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/forms-576x240.webp 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/forms.webp 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>  </strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Progressive profiling is a method of collecting relevant information on your leads, through dynamic form fields, to ask for and collect information on users based on the information you already have about them.</p>



<p>Such questions may include; What’s your name? What’s the best contact number to call you on? How can we help? Then, as the customer’s interaction with your service continues (and greater trust and brand recognition is built), more questions are asked – helping you to not only capture leads, but build on the intelligence you’ve gained.</p>



<p>By using progressive and lead nurturing forms on your website, you’re able to progressively ask for new pieces of information about your lead using the same form each time they interact with it. Progressive forms allows you to learn more about your website visitors’ interests, requirements, and demographic profiles each time they interact with you online.</p>



<p><u>What are the Benefits of Progressive Profiling?</u></p>



<p>Progressive profiling is a valuable marketing tool for strengthening and qualifying your leads that saves you time, avoids repetition, and leads to higher conversions. With this, your visitors will enjoy a more tailored, user friendly experience on your site and hopefully become paying customers. Here are 4 benefits:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Shorter lead forms;</li>



<li>Higher conversion rates;</li>



<li>Collecting more relevant information about your leads;</li>



<li>Building more genuine relationships with your leads and</li>
</ul>



<p>When used appropriately, progressive profiling allows you to gather important information, as well as build lead intelligence on repeat conversions. In a nutshell, it enables business owners to capture lead data without being annoying or aggressive.</p>

<p>When websites and web tools are appropriately designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them much more efficiently. However, many websites today are developed with accessibility barriers that makes it difficult or impossible for some people to use.</p>



<p><em>“The new WCAG 2.2 release impacts 2021 Web Accessibility”</em></p>



<p><em>&nbsp;</em>– Source: EssentialAccessibility.com, September 2020.</p>



<p>W3C has specified that this update delivers additional support for website users with cognitive and learning disabilities, those with poor vision, or with specific disabilities, on mobile devices.</p>



<p>Making websites accessible benefits individuals and businesses. International web standards define what is needed for accessibility. The main types of disability to consider are people with:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Visual impairments;</li>



<li>Hearing impairments;</li>



<li>Mobility impairments;</li>



<li>Cognitive</li>
</ul>



<p>Elements that improve accessibility include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Producing strong colour contrasts between the content and backgrounds;</li>



<li>Using labels and instructions on forms, rather than low-context placeholder text;</li>



<li>Using practical alt tags for images (which also boosts SEO!);</li>



<li>Adding focus indicators, such as the rectangular outline that shows up around links when using keyboard navigation;</li>
</ul>



<p>Having a site that every visitor can navigate and interact with is more than just part of good customer service and providing an excellent experience. It can increase conversion, boost your SEO, and help you reach a bigger audience.</p>



<p>To conclude, all website users benefit from accessible web design, just like we can all use automatic doors and other accessibility features often found in the physical world. Consider your user’s intentions and find ways to align their website behaviours with your business goals.</p>

<p>Page speed is nothing new and has long been a Google ranking factor. But in 2021, Google will be doubling down with the introduction of Core Web Vitals in the upcoming Core Algorithm Update. The new Core Web Vitals are a list of metrics created to help business owners, marketers, and developers improve user page experience.</p>



<p><u>What are the Core Web Vitals?</u></p>



<p>In May of 2020 Google announced their new Page Experience Update and the addition of Core Web Vitals. The Core Web Vitals will be added to a list of ranking factors which Google calls ‘page experience metrics’, as follows:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Mobile friendliness;</li>



<li>Safe browsing;</li>



<li>Https;</li>



<li>No intrusive interstitials;</li>



<li>Largest contentful paint (under 2.5 for 75% of page loads);</li>



<li>First input delay (under 100 milliseconds for 75% of page loads);</li>



<li>Cumulative layout shift (less than 0.1 for 75% of page loads).</li>
</ul>



<p>A slow website, on the other hand, makes us think it’s unsafe, insecure, and untrustworthy. And it’s really difficult to turn around that negative first impression. On the other hand, If your website loads fast, you’ve instantly made a strong first impression. It’s a quick win for user experience! If it loads fast, your new visitor is immediately happy.</p>



<p>Speed in 2021 continues to matter more so than ever before. It affects your user experience, as well as your search ranking. It affects your sales and conversions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In 2021, we expect to see a strong emphasis of clean, bright, eye-catching websites that use animation and video to enhance the user experience. Updating your website’s design, and making sure it’s accessible, can have a positive impact on your brand and sales. If we had to summarise future web design future in 3 words, it would be: <em>Fast, Accessible </em>and <em>Engaging</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever sat on a website and did not know what to do? Or couldn’t find the menu? These are all examples of poorly thought UX. The key to any website succeeding is to make the user think as little as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 class="gradient">”Don’t make me think&#8221;</h4>
<p class="gradient"><strong>&#8211; Steve Krugs</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This depicts that a user will always choose the first available solution to their problem. Thus a site should be as easy to navigate and direct as possible whilst still retaining the aesthetics.</p>
<h3>What are UX and UI? What does it mean?</h3>
<ul>
<li>A UX (User Experience) designer is responsible for creating a product – or site that users will find easy to use and enjoyable.</li>
<li>A UI (User Interface Designer) are responsible for the look, feel and focus of the website’s style and aesthetic design.</li>
</ul>
<p>In many ways, these roles fall hand in hand. A successful website falls to two things: Is it easy to use, and the aesthetics of it. A website can look incredible and benefit hugely from well thought out design, but if the user can’t find what they are looking for efficiently, ultimately they will give up and leave. Similarly, a website that has a fantastic interface but looks dreadful is not going to engage with a user.</p>
<p>Over time – Principles have been implemented as a guide for designers, ensuring that simple but effective elements are considered when designing, we’ve picked a few key ones below for you:</p>
<h3 class="gradient">1. Research Research Research</h3>
<p>There is no such thing as too much.</p>
<p>Hopefully, it won’t come as much of a surprise when we tell you, that one of the most important factors, to begin with, is to carry out user research. To create the perfect site or product for your client, you first have to look at who their market is.</p>
<p>Without it, product designs will only be based on the designers’ personal experience, which isn’t the objective. Much like a house, researching and creating that first fundamental design, is like creating the foundations of a house. Get it wrong, or not capture the objective right, and it can end up derailing the entire project.</p>
<p>So, what are the type of questions you need to be asking yourself?</p>
<p>First and foremost:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the site selling/demonstrating?</li>
<li>Why are people looking at this?</li>
<li>What is the overarching goal?</li>
</ul>
<p>When a person purchases a product, they aren’t investing in a product, but a better version of themselves.</p>
<h3 class="gradient">2. Ditch the Lorum Ipsum</h3>
<p>Clients aren’t looking for a website that feels or looks generic. 99% of Sites, are built or based around existing products or content. If it’s there, use it!</p>
<p>Although Lorem Ipsum is a frequent participant in any UX design, the more real-life content you can use the better! Not only does it help the client invision your wireframe once fully designed, but it can help establish any potential issues that may arise later down the line.</p>
<p>Whilst Lorem Ipsum can be manipulated to fit perfectly with your design, ultimately, the real context may not be as conveniently sized. Meaning the site’s flawless design could easily end up looking pretty disjointed and clunky.</p>
<h3 class="gradient">3. Keep it Simple</h3>
<p>Have you ever opened an application or site and been flooded with information, so much so you get confused and leave it? You’re not alone. Each person has a limited amount of information that they can hold in their working memory. Similar to a computer’s processing powers! When the amount of information provided to us exceeds this – Our Cognitive Load has been overflown. We take longer to process, get overwhelmed or ultimately abandon it altogether.</p>
<h3 class="gradient">4. Minimise the Cognitive Load, To Maximise the Experience</h3>
<p>Possibly one of the most popular and well-known principle laws within UX design is that of psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman. It applies the simple idea that the more choices presented to a user, the longer it will take them to achieve the result.</p>
<h3 class="gradient">5. Keep It Consistent</h3>
<p>One of the hallmark features of a great site is consistency throughout.</p>
<p>Creating a site that needs a manual to navigate, is a site that isn’t going to succeed. No matter what site we are on, we already hold certain expectations and schemas around what certain things will do. If there is an envelope symbol, we assume it will open a blank email. Having fonts that change from page to page, or designs of the pages will only lead to confusion and frustration. Pick a style, and run with it.</p>
<p>Although it’s fantastic to create an innovative and modern site, trying to reinvent the wheel won’t guarantee success.</p>
<h3 class="gradient">6. Learn Information Architecture</h3>
<p>Information Architecture or IA for short, refers to the structuring of the information to guide the user around the site, similar to the map guiding you to the treasure.</p>
<p>Information architects work to create findable and contextual content for the user. If a site is being remapped out, and changes are being made to the site, then IA plays a huge part in renavigating users to their final destinations. Often simple forms of IA are things such as Sitemaps, and Navigation around the site.</p>
<p>The larger the site, and complex the content, the more thought and organisation that needs to be implemented to ensure the users reach their goals!</p>
<h3 class="gradient">7. Learn the Laws of UX</h3>
<p>Whilst ‘design’ covers everything and anything from websites design to graphic design, there are a few underline rules every designer should know about. Pretty much every rule is based on the foundations of human-computer interaction or HCI. It explores the way people perceive and interact with digital content.</p>
<p>A fabulous resource created by Jon Yablonski called laws of UX outlines some of the key psychological and cognitive theories behind UX design, perfect as the starting point for any UX Designer.</p>
<h3 class="gradient">8. Space, The Final&#8230;Design Key?</h3>
<p>The philosophy of Proximity explains the ideas that when elements on a page are within proximity of one another, our mind will naturally group these.</p>
<p>This key principle can be applied throughout the UX/UI design for grouping similar or related information together. It can eliminate confusion and can help establish a hierarchy to the content. White spaces or blank areas play a vital area in this as the vast contrast against the content guides the user in the correct direction. We can apply the principle to pretty much everything from navigation bars to galleries and banners.</p>
<h3 class="gradient">9. UX/UI is a Team Sport</h3>
<p>More problems can be solved together than on our own. Collaboration between developers and designers are key to creating a seamless site that utilises all of the designers’ ideas. Additionally, who is better to try your new prototypes out on, than the people who want to make it the best version possible. Your teammates and colleagues can provide insights and ideas that perhaps you hadn’t even considered or spot issues of usability problems that need negating. UX/UI is built around a user’s experience, so use your colleagues, and find out their experience.</p>
<p>A website should never make users think too hard, instead it&#8217;s a combination of solid research, intuitive structure and seamless design.</p>
